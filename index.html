If she prevails, she can reunite a pair of priceless heirloom swords separated decades earlier, and avenge her father, who was paralyzed in his own duel.</p><p>Then a messenger from the Emperor arrives, demanding that all families send one soldier to fight the Rouran invaders in the north. Mulan's father cannot go. Her brother is just a child. So she ties up her hair, takes up her sword, and joins the army as a man.</p><p><b>A War for a Dynasty</b><br>Thanks to her martial arts skills, Mulan is chosen for an elite team under the command of the princeling--the royal duke's son, who is also the handsomest man she's ever seen. But the princeling has secrets of his own, which explode into Mulan's life and shake up everything she knows. As they cross the Great Wall to face the enemy beyond, Mulan and the princeling must find a way to unwind their past, unmask a traitor, and uncover the plans for the Rouran invasion . . . before it's too late.</p><p>Inspired by <em>wuxia</em> martial-arts dramas as well as the centuries-old ballad of Mulan, <em>The Magnolia Sword</em> is perfect for fans of Renee Ahdieh, Marie Lu, or Kristin Cashore--a thrilling, romantic, and sharp-edged novel that lives up to its beloved heroine.</p></p><p><p>SHERRY THOMAS is the author of nineteen novels across multiple genres, including the acclaimed Lady Sherlock mystery series, a YA fantasy trilogy that began with The Burning Sky, and more than a dozen romance novels, which have twice won her the Romance Writers of America's prestigious RITA(R) Award. Born in China, she learned English as a second language, and now lives and writes in Austin, Texas.</p>Rich cultural references, intricate political machinations, and thrilling Wuxia elements distinguish this deftly woven Mulan retelling by Thomas, who was born and raised in China. . . . Skillful martial arts scenes combine with crucial discourse on power, gender, and the impact of language on history in this gripping, thoughtfully layered reinterpretation. --Starred review, Publishers Weekly<br><br>New life is breathed into the ballad of Mulan. . . . Thomas (The Hollow of Fear, 2018, etc.) brings new dimensions to the iconic character, weaving emotional depth and ethnic political issues into the plot. She immerses readers in bustling city streets and freezing swaths of wilderness. Scaffolded by detailed research, the story is based on actual historic conflicts and artifacts. A refreshing new take that pays homage to a legendary character. --Kirkus Reviews<br><br>The camaraderie among the princeling's staff (and Mulan's matchmaking between two of the men) will draw readers in, even as intrigue over a traitorous spy and a government coup heighten the suspense. It is Mulan's story, however--her rocky introduction to combat and her growth in valor, plus the growing attraction between her and the princeling--that makes this revisioning of the ancient Chinese legend (that also inspired the animated Disney feature, scheduled for an upcoming live-action treatment) such a captivating tale. --The Horn Book Magazine</p><h2>Blue Exorcist, Vol. 17 (17)</h2><p>Rin and his exorcist classmates are caught in a secret war against the forces of darkness.<br><br>Raised by Father Fujimoto, a famous exorcist, Rin Okumura never knew his real father.

The boy was beckoning me to join him on a voyage through the harrowing straits of memory. He was gambling that if we survived the passage, we might discover an ocean where the past would become the wind at our back rather than a driving gale to the nose of our boat. This book is the record of that voyage."</i> <i>&nbsp;</i><br><br>At the age of sixteen, Ian Morgan Cron was told by his mother that his father, a motion picture executive, also worked for the CIA in Europe. This astonishing revelation, coupled with his father's dark struggles with alcoholism, upended the world of a boy struggling to become a man. Decades later, as he faces his own personal demons, Ian realizes the only way to find peace is to voyage back through a childhood marked by extremes--privilege and hardship, violence and tenderness, truth and deceit--that he's spent years trying to forget. In this surprisingly funny and forgiving memoir, Ian reminds us that no matter how different the pieces may be, in the end we are all cut from the same cloth, stitched by faith into an exquisite quilt of grace.</p><p>"Ian Morgan Cron writes with astonishing energy and freshness; his metaphors stick fast in the imagination. This is neither a simple memoir of hurt endured, nor a tidy story of reconciliation and resolution. It is - rather like Augustine's Confessions - a testimony to the unfinished business of grace." <br><b><br>- The Most Rev. Dr. Rowan Williams - The Archbishop of Canterbury</b><br>"Simultaneously redemptive and consoling with bright moments of humor...this story is chock-full of sacredness and hope. Cron is one of only a few spirituality authors who could articulate these themes as poignantly."<br><br><b>Publishers Weekly</b><br>"Ian Morgan Cron writes with astonishing energy and freshness; his metaphors stick fast in the imagination.

Read this profound book and be well fed, and freed."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><b>-Fr. Richard Rohr, author of Everything Belongs: The Gift of Contemplative Prayer</b><br>"Much tongue-in-cheek humor (and pain) in a fast-paced narrative...the author's English major shines through with an interesting, well-written plot of pain and redemption. Cron's realism and lack of bitterness are a refreshing blend.&nbsp;A powerful story of faith and forgiveness."<br><br><b>Kirkus Reviews</b><br><br><br>"Ian Cron is a brilliant writer. This is the kind of book that you don't just read. It reads you." <br><br><b>- Mark Batterson, author of <i>In a Pit with a Lion on a Snowy Day: How to Survive and Thrive When Opportunity Roars </i></b><br><br><br>"Ian Cron walks us through the drama of his life, making us laugh and cry with him every step of the way. His memoir is filled with everything from boyhood stories of celebrating communion in the woods to chipmunks and blue jays, to poignant reflections about growing up with an alcoholic father. Ian's honesty, vulnerability, and humor will bring a measure of healing to all who go on the journey with him."<br><br><b>-Jim Wallis, President of Sojourners, and best-selling author of God's Politics, and Rediscovering Values</b><br>"I like stories. And this is a good one. Ian Cron has a ton to teach the world. And he's gentle as he does it. Here it is: The Gospel of Ian... not in the top four gospels, but it's pretty magnificent. And it's sure evidence that God continues to tell the extraordinary story of grace through the lives of ordinary people."<br>&nbsp;<br>-<b>Shane Claiborne, author and activist, and co-compiler of Common Prayer</b><br><br><br>"Simply&nbsp;the best memoir I have read in years. It is engaging, clever, heartbreaking, and God-drenched in all the right ways."<br><br><b>- Phyllis Tickle, author of <i>The Great Emergence: How Christianity Is Changing and Why</i></b><br><br><br>"There are books you have to read because they are important for your work and books you want to read because they humanize you and deepen your soul.&nbsp; This is one of those want-to-read books, a portal that transports you into the struggles of childhood, the agony of alcoholism, the joys of coming of age, the terror and hope of parenthood, and the mystery of faith. Enthusiastically recommended."<br><br><b>-Brian McLaren, author of Naked Spirituality: A Life with God in 12 Simple Words </b><br>&nbsp;"Ian is an absolutely magnificent writer, and this memoir is a stunning work. With Miles Davis and squirrels and weddings and Red Bull and fawns and cliff diving--it's like he has this bottomless bucket of images and metaphors and they're all so spot-on brilliant. I literally had to put the book down several times because I began tearing up. &nbsp;What a gift!"<br><br><b>- Rob Bell, best-selling author of <i>Love Wins</i> and <i>Velvet Elvis</i></b><i>&nbsp;</i><br>"Ian Cron's story is a compelling one. Every turn of the page draws you closer to God."<br><b><br>-Craig Groeschel, author of <i>The Christian Atheist&nbsp;</i></b><br>"At once touching and profound, poignant and full of grace, this is compelling writing of the highest order. &nbsp;I can't imagine anyone not being drawn deeper into the momentum of God's healing Spirit."<br><br><b>Jeremy Begbie, musician and Thomas A. Langford Research Professor of Theology, Duke University Divinity School; author, <i>Resounding Truth: Christian Wisdom in the World of Music</i></b><br><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br><br>"Ian Morgan Cron's daring writing lays bare the human journey with grace and wit.

Laura was at her computer in the study, as usual, but she quickly reached for the receiver. She knew who was calling.<br><br>"He's asking for you," the nurse said. "I think you'd better hurry."<br><br>"I'll be right there."<br><br>She ran through the living room, past the darkened Christmas tree and up the stairs to the second floor of the town house. Although she tried to be quiet, the bedroom door squeaked as she opened it, and Ray lifted his head from the pillow. He was never an easy sleeper.<br><br>"The hospital called," she said, slipping off her robe and pulling a pair of jeans from her dresser drawer. "I have to go."<br><br>Ray sat up and switched on his bedside light. "Is he...?" He didn't finish the sentence as he reached for his glasses on the night table. He looked dazed, blinking against the intrusion of light in the room.<br><br>"He's still alive," she said. "But I think this is it." She heard the lack of emotion in her voice as the calm and collected scientist in her took over.<br><br>"I'll come with you," Ray said, throwing off the covers. "I'll get Emma up and she and I can wait in&#x2014;"<br><br>"No." She pulled her sweater over her head, then leaned over to kiss him. "You and Emma stay here. No sense waking her up. Besides, I need to get there quickly."<br><br>"All right." Ray smoothed his hands over his thinning brown hair. "But call if you change your mind and want us to come."<br><br>He looked like an oversized little boy, sitting on the edge of the bed in his striped pajamas, and Laura felt a quick surge of love for him. "I will," she said, giving him a hug. "Thanks."<br><br>Outside, the air was still and cold. She drove quickly through the neighborhood, the houses and trees ablaze with colored lights. On the main road through Leesburg, she hit red light after red light, and even though the streets were nearly empty, she stopped dutifully at each of them.<br><br>Her father had wanted no heroic measures, and he'd received none. Although Laura agreed philosophically with his decision, her emotions were another matter, and these past few days she'd been hoping for a miracle. She wasn't ready to lose him. Carl Brandon had been the one consistent person in her life, always there for her. Her relationship with him had not been perfect, but who had a perfect relationship with their father? He'd turned eighty a few months ago, right after the cancer came back. She'd given him a party after hours in the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum, turning on the planetarium lights for him. It would be his last party, and she knew there was nothing he would love better than to gaze at the sea of stars above him. He'd nearly ignored the guests in favor of the mechanically created sky.<br><br>Only a few cars were parked in the visitors' lot, and she found a spot close to the hospital entrance. Inside, the lobby was eerily empty and dimly lit. Shivering as she walked through it, she tried to prepare herself for what lay ahead. She would find her father at peace. He was not afraid of dying, and that comforted her. He had an astronomer's appreciation of his own irrelevance. When your passion was the sky and the stars and the planets, the insignificance of your life was a given.<br><br>So, she would hold his hand as he drifted away from her. She would be very strong. Then she would drive home and Ray would comfort her. In the morning, she would tell Emma that Poppa had died. She had already tried to explain to her five-year-old daughter about Poppa's illness, trying to equate what was happening to him to what had happened to Emma's guinea pig the year before. But Emma, despite asking dozens of questions, seemed unable to grasp the concept of <em>forever. </em>And Laura, who had always scoffed at the notion of heaven, found herself using the idea to comfort Emma. And at times, herself.<br><br>She knew the instant she entered her father's room that he was not at peace. He was clearly worse than when she'd seen him that afternoon. His breathing was raspier, his skin grayer, and he was agitated. As he reached for her, his long arms trembling in the air, he wore a look of desperation on his once-handsome face.<br><br>She took his hand and sat on the edge of his bed.<br><br>"I'm here, Dad." She guessed he had not wanted to die without her at his side and wished she'd ignored those red lights to get to the hospital sooner.<br><br>He held both her hands in his weak grasp, but even with her there, the desperate look did not leave his eyes. He tried to speak, the words coming out between his gasps for air. "Should... have...told..." he said.<br><br>She leaned close to hear him. From that angle, she could see the stars of Aries through the hospital window. "Don't try to speak, Dad." She smoothed a tuft of white hair away from his temple.<br><br>"A woman," he said. "You need..." Her father's face, gaunt and gray, tightened with frustration as he struggled to get the words out.<br><br>"I need to what, Dad?" she asked gently.<br><br>"Look..." His lips trembled from the strain of speaking. "Look after her," he said.<br><br>Laura drew away to study his face. Could he be delusional? "Okay," she said. "I will. Please don't try to talk anymore."<br><br>He let go of her hand to reach toward the night table, his arm jerking with the motion. Laura saw the scrap of paper he was aiming for and picked it up herself. Her father had written a name on the paper in a nearly illegible scrawl that threatened to break her heart.<br><br>"Sarah Tolley," Laura read. "Who is that?"<br><br>"Friend," he said. "Important...has no...family." He swallowed with effort, his Adam's apple a sharp blade beneath the skin of his throat. "Promise."<br><br>He wanted her to look after a woman named Sarah Tolley?<br><br>"But...who is she?" Laura asked. <em>"Where </em>is she?"<br><br>His eyes were closed. "Meadow...Wood..."<br><br>"Meadow Wood Village?" Laura pictured the attractive, Victorian-style retirement home on the outskirts of Leesburg.<br><br>He nodded. At least she thought he did.<br><br>"Can you tell me what you want me to do for her?" she asked.<br><br>"Take care..."<br><br>"Take care of her?" Laura asked. "But I don't know her, Dad. I've never even heard you talk about her before."<br><br>Her father's paper-thin eyelids fluttered open, and she saw panic in his eyes. "Promise!" he said. In a nearly spasmodic movement, he reached toward her as if trying to grasp her shoulders, but he caught his fingers in the chain of her necklace instead. She felt the chain snap, and the pendant fell into her lap.<br><br>Unsettled by his panic, she caught his hands. "It's all right, Daddy," she said. "I promise. I'll take care of her."<br><br>"Swear..."<br><br>"I'll do it, Dad." She leaned back to slip the scrap of paper into her jeans pocket. "You don't need to worry."<br><br>He sank back against the pillow, pointing one trembling finger toward her neck. "I broke..."<br><br>"It's all right." She lifted the necklace from her lap and slipped it, too, into her jeans pocket. "It can be fixed." She took his hand again and held it on her thigh. "You rest now," she said.<br><br>Obediently, he closed his eyes, their small battle over. Small battles were nothing new between them. Her mother had died when Laura was seven, and her father had been a difficult parent, demanding and controlling, but always attentive. She had been his top priority, and she knew it. He'd instilled in her his love of astronomy, although for him it had been a cherished avocation rather than a profession, and he was responsible for the person she'd become. His methodical shaping of her had at times been painful and contentious, but she was grateful for it.<br><br>She sat there for hours, holding her father's hand as it grew slacker and cooler in her own. Taped to the wall was a picture Emma had drawn for him a few days earlier. It was one of those typical five-year-old's drawings. Vivid blue sky. Yellow sun. Green tree. A child dressed in blue and purple, wearing a broad smile, the sort of smile Emma herself wore more often than not. Laura studied the drawing, saddened by the incongruity of that happy child with the scene in this room.<br><br>She looked out the window again. Aries was gone, but she could see Jupiter near the center of Aquarius. She closed her eyes, and it was a minute before she realized that her father's breathing had stopped. Sitting very still, she held his lifeless hand in hers, as the room filled with a silence as deep as the sky.<br><br>The eastern skywas purplewiththe approaching dawn when she arrived home from the hospital. Ray was brewing coffee, wearing his blue terry-cloth robe, a splash of color in the white, uncluttered kitchen. He walked toward her once she was in the door, his arms outstretched, and she could tell he hadn't slept well. Dark circles marred the skin beneath his eyes, and the stubble of his beard was white. For a moment, she felt the fear of losing him, too. He was sixty-one, twenty-one years older than she, and these last few years had taken a toll on him. When she buried her head against his shoulder, she wasn't sure if her tears were for her father or her husband.<br><br>"He died about an hour ago," she said, drawing away from him. She wiped her eyes with a tissue, then took the mug of coffee he handed her and sat down at the table.<br><br>"I'm glad you got to be there with him," he said.<br><br>"It was upsetting." She held the mug between her cold hands. "I thought I'd just sit with him while he... slipped away. But he was very anxious. Really wired. He asked me to take care of some woman I've never even heard him talk about before, and he made me promise I'd do it. It was as if he couldn't let himself die until I swore I'd take care of her."<br><br>Ray frowned. "Who's the woman? And what did he mean by 'take care of?"<br><br>Laura reached into her jeans pocket for the scrap of paper, which she flattened on the table. "Sarah Tolley," she said. "She lives in Meadow Wood Village. You know, that retirement home?"<br><br>Ray turned away from her to pour himself more coffee. He was quiet, and she imagined that he, too, was trying to puzzle out her father's request. His body looked thick and shapeless beneath the robe. Too heavy. It wasn't healthy to carry around so much weight. She wished he'd take better care of himself.<br><br>"And you don't know her connection to Carl?" he asked finally, his back still to her.<br><br>"I have no idea. He said she's a special friend. Or important. I don't remember his exact words. He could barely speak." The conversation with her father now seemed vague, as if she'd dreamed it. "He said, or at least implied, that she has no one else to take care of her. No family."<br><br>"Sweetheart." Ray sat down at the ancient oak table and rested his hand on top of hers. "I think this was the ranting of a dying man," he said. "You know he's suffered from dementia on and off this past week. The medication&#x2014;"<br><br>"I know, but he seemed clearheaded about this. You should have seen him, Ray. It was so important to him. And where would he get this name from?" She pulled her hand from his to touch the scrap of paper. "She must mean something to him. Maybe he had another life we knew nothing about. I'm going to call Meadow Wood Village later today to see if this woman actually lives there."<br><br>Ray's expression was the one he wore when he lobbied politicians on Capitol Hill. She saw the calculated patience in his face, the tightness in his lips, and knew he was choosing his words with care.<br><br>"It's probably not a good time to discuss this," he said, his tone even, his hand on hers again, "because you're understandably upset and feeling pretty emotional about Carl. But I really want you to think about the fact that he ran your life when he was alive and now he's trying to control it from the grave."<br><br>She knew what he was talking about. Sometimes her father's love had seemed tied to her achievements, and, no matter what she accomplished, it was never quite enough. But it seemed harsh, almost cruel, for Ray to imply that her father's deathbed wish was a final act of manipulation.<br><br>She leaned toward her husband, feeling tears fill her eyes. "This is the last thing my father will ever ask of me," she said. "I promised him I'd do as he requested, Ray, and I will.

Ray slammed his mug on the table so hard she jumped, and coffee splashed onto the white place mat. He stood up. "Here you go again, throwing yourself off the deep end headfirst. Don't you have enough to do? Aren't Emma and I ever enough to satisfy you?"<br><br>Startled by his outburst, she could not find her voice. She stared at her husband while he plowed ahead.<br><br>"Why do you always need to have a million projects going at once?" he asked. "Have you looked at your life lately? You just got back from a month of research in Brazil, you drive to Baltimore to teach at Hopkins one day a week, you're overextended at the Smithsonian, and last week you told me you're going back to Brazil next summer. What happened to your promise to <em>us, </em>huh?" He leaned on the table, his hands balled into fists. His knuckles were white.<br><br>Laura reached out to touch his hand, confused by his sudden, dramatic change of heart. "But you said it was fine for me to&#x2014;"<br><br>"You said we could spend next summer at the lake house, just the three of us," he interrupted her. "Like a normal family, instead of one where the wife and mother drags her kid all over the place, chasing comets and traveling around the world giving speeches and accepting awards and who knows what other crap, while her husband sits home and gets rejection letter after fucking rejection letter." He stood up and wiped the back of his hand across his chin. The white bristles of his beard stood out against the red of his face.<br><br>Laura pressed her fist to her mouth, stunned by his uncharacteristic fury. He'd never spoken to her this way before, never uttered a word of complaint about her career. She'd had no idea his unhappiness with her ran so deep.<br><br>"Mommy?"<br><br></p><h2>Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the Government&#39;s Biggest Cover-up (Revised and Expanded Edition)</h2><p>The best-selling UFO book of 2007/2008 is revised and updated with even more hard-hitting eyewitness testimony of one of the most important eventsof all time: the actual recovery of a UFO outside of Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.

It pries loose the truth the government doesn't want us to know.

Ira Katznelson examines the New Deal through the lens of a pervasive, almost existential fear that gripped a world defined by the collapse of capitalism and the rise of competing dictatorships, as well as a fear created by the ruinous racial divisions in American society. Katznelson argues that American democracy was both saved and distorted by a Faustian collaboration that guarded racial segregation as it built a new national state to manage capitalism and assert global power. Fear Itself charts the creation of the modern American state and &#x201c;how a belief in the common good gave way to a central government dominated by interest-group politics and obsessed with national security&#x201d; (Louis Menand, <em>The New Yorker</em>). 24 illustrations</p><p>Ira Katznelson is Columbia University&#39;s Ruggles Professor of Political Science and History.

It is an exhilarating pleasure to lose yourself in this old-fashioned example of original historical scholarship. <em>Fear Itself</em> is a sprawling, ambitious book that offers illuminating insights on nearly every page.

Whether the boy is a modern-day Huck Finn or not, Trinity Harbor is in an uproar. But for Daisy Spencer, guiding the orphaned ten-year-old is easy, an escape from her own tragic past. She can ignore the town's nay-saying. The only real obstacle is...that man.&nbsp;<br><br><em>That man</em> is the boy's uncle, Walker Ames, a tough DC cop who sees his unexpected nephew as his last chance at redemption. Soon he's commuting to the charming fishbowl of a town, where everyone assumes he's seduced Daisy&#x2014;their <em>best</em> Sunday-school teacher! But to Walker, Daisy is a disconcerting mix of charming innocence and smart-mouthed excitement in a town that's not as sleepy as it looks.</p><p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina. Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.<br><br>Daisy Spencer had always wanted children. She just hadn't expected to wind up stealing one.<br><br>Okay, that was a slight exaggeration. She hadn't exactly stolen Tommy Flanagan. The way she saw it, nobody wanted the boy. His father was long gone and his pitiful, frail mother had had the misfortune to die in the recent flu epidemic. The story was the talk of Trinity Harbor and had been for weeks now.<br><br>While they searched for relatives, Social Services had placed Tommy with three different foster families in as many weeks, but Tommy wouldn't stay put. He was scared and angry and about as receptive to love as that vicious old rooster Daisy's father insisted on keeping over at Cedar Hill.<br><br>Despite all that, Daisy's heart just about broke when she thought of all the pain that ten-year-old had gone through. She figured she had more than enough love to spare for the little boy who'd been one of her brightest Sunday school students, a boy who was suddenly all alone in the world, a boy who'd lost his faith in God on the day his mother died.<br><br>Daisy's own faith had been tested half a dozen years ago when she'd been told she would never have children of her own. The news had almost destroyed her. It <em>had </em>destroyed her relationship with Billy Inscoe, the only man she'd ever loved.<br><br>All Daisy had cared about was having children she could shower with love. Adoption would have suited her just fine.<br><br>But Billy hadn't been able to see beyond the fact that his fianc�e was barren. Billy had wanted sons and daughters of his own. He'd wanted his blood running through their veins, proof of his manhood running through the streets. He'd wanted to start a dynasty as proud as the Spencers'. When Daisy couldn't give him that, he'd taken back his ring and gone looking for someone who could.<br><br>With the exception of Daisy's minister, nobody knew the truth about what had happened between her and Billy. Daisy kept quiet because she'd been so humiliated by the discovery that she wasn't woman enough to give Billy what he thought he needed from a wife. Billy had been discreet for his own reasons.<br><br>Her own father thought the broken engagement was the result of some whim on her part, as if she'd turned her back on marriage because she thought someone better might be waiting around the next corner. He couldn't conceive of the possibility that his handpicked choice for her had been the one to walk out, and Daisy had let him have his illusions.<br><br>And so, until this morning Daisy had pretty much considered her dream of a family dead and buried, right along with every bit of respect and love she'd ever felt for Billy Inscoe.<br><br>The last few years she'd thrown herself into her job teaching history at the local high school. She was advisor for the yearbook, the drama club and the 4-H. She taught Sunday school classes. She took her friends' children fishing on the banks of the Potomac River and on outings to Stratford Hall, the birthplace of Robert E. Lee, or Wakefield, the birthplace of George Washington, both of which were nearby. She gardened, nurturing flowers and vegetables the way she'd always wanted to nurture her own babies.<br><br>Heaven help her, she'd even brought home a cat for company, though the independent Molly spent precious little time with her mistress unless she was hungry. And as if to mock Daisy, she'd just had her second litter of kittens.<br><br>In another era, Daisy would have been labeled a boring spinster, even though she'd barely turned thirty. Frankly, there were times when that was exactly what she felt like: a dull, dried-up old lady. The role she'd always envisioned herself playing&#x2014;wife and mother&#x2014;seemed totally beyond her grasp. She was on the verge of resigning herself to living on the fringes of other people's lives, to being Aunt Daisy once her brothers married and had families of their own.<br><br>Today, though, everything had changed. Early this morning she'd gone to the garage and found Tommy, cold and shivering in the spring chill. He'd been wearing a pair of filthy jeans, a sweater that had been claimed from the church thrift shop even though it was two sizes too big and a pair of sneakers that were clearly too small for his growing feet. His blond hair was matted beneath a Baltimore Orioles baseball cap, and his freckles seemed to stand out even more than usual against his pale complexion.<br><br>Despite the sorry state he was in, the boy had been scared and defiant and distrustful. But eventually she'd been able to talk him into coming inside, where she'd fixed him a breakfast of eggs, bacon, hash browns, grits and toast. He'd devoured it all as if he were half-starved, all the while watching her warily. Only in the last few minutes had Tommy slowed down. He was pushing the last of his eggs around on his plate as if fearful of what might happen once he was done.<br><br>Studying him, for the first time in years Daisy felt a stirring of excitement. Her prayers had been answered. She felt alive, as if she finally had a mission. Mothering this boy was something she'd been meant to do. And she intended to cling to that sensation with everything in her. Even Molly seemed to agree. She'd been purring and rubbing against Tommy since he'd arrived.<br><br>"I ain't going to another foster home," Tommy declared, allowing his fork to clatter against his plate in emphasis.<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>He regarded her suspiciously. "You ain't gonna make me?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"How come?"<br><br>"Because I intend to let you stay right here, at least until things settle down." Even as she said the words, she realized she'd made the decision the minute she'd seen him.<br><br>His gaze narrowed. "Settle down how?"<br><br>Daisy wasn't sure of that herself. Her heart had opened up the instant she discovered Tommy in her garage, but she was smart enough to know that she couldn't just decide to keep him. Frances Jackson over at Social Services was looking for relatives, and there were probably a thousand other legalities to consider. All Daisy knew was that if she had anything at all to say about it, this boy had run away for the last time. Maybe for once, being a Spencer would be a blessing. People might like to gossip about the family, but they tended to bow to their wishes.<br><br>"You'll just have to trust me," she said eventually.<br><br>He scowled at that. "Don't know why I should."<br><br>She hid a grin, wondering what made her think this smart-mouthed kid was a gift from above.<br><br>She gave him a stern look. "Because I have been your Sunday school teacher since you were a toddler, Tommy Flanagan, and I don't lie."<br><br>"Never said you did," he mumbled. "Just don't know why I should think you're any different than all those other people who promised I'd get to stay, then kicked me out."<br><br>"Nobody kicked you out. You keep running away," she reminded him. "Isn't that right?"<br><br>He shrugged off the distinction. "I suppose."<br><br>"Why did you do that?"<br><br>"They just took me in because they had to. I know when I'm not wanted. I just made it easy for 'em."<br><br>"Okay, then, for however long it takes to find your family&#x2014;or forever, if it comes to that&#x2014;you are going to have a home right here with me. And I'm going to see to it that you don't have any reason to want to run away. Don't take that to mean I'm going to be a pushover, though."<br><br>She said it emphatically and without the slightest hesitation. Her gaze locked with his. "Do we have an understanding?"<br><br>"I guess," he said, apparently satisfied for the moment that she meant what she said.<br><br>Relief washed through her. This was going to work out. She could feel it. Daisy didn't even consider the fact that she'd caught him trying to hot-wire her car as a bad omen. Hopefully Tommy wouldn't mention that little detail to anyone. She certainly didn't intend to.<br><br>She did worry ever so slightly about the repercussions once word got back to her father, but she was convinced she could handle that, too. She just hoped it would take the grapevine a little longer than usual to reach Cedar Hill. King wasn't as easily won over as a scared kid.<br><br>In the meantime, she knew she did have to call Frances Jackson. Frances took her job at Social Services very seriously. Tommy's disappearances were wearing on her nerves. Daisy reached for the portable phone.<br><br>"Who're you calling?" Tommy demanded, scowling.<br><br>"Mrs. Jackson. She needs to know that you're with me and that you're okay."<br><br>"Don't see why." He gave her a pleading look. "Couldn't we just keep this between us? You tell her, and the next thing we know she'll have the sheriff over here hauling my butt away."<br><br>"The sheriff won't lay a hand on you," Daisy reassured him fiercely, but she put the phone back on the table.<br><br>"How come?"<br><br>"Because the sheriff is my brother and he'll do what I tell him to do." At least she hoped he would.<br><br>Tommy still looked skeptical. "Have you got something on him?"<br><br>Daisy chuckled. "Not the way you mean. Just leave handling Tucker to me. It won't be a problem. Besides, when you go back to school on Monday, people are going to want to know where you're staying. We might as well be up-front about it."<br><br>"I thought maybe I wouldn't go back," he said, looking hopeful. "It's almost summer, anyway."<br><br>"Not a chance," Daisy said firmly. "Education is too important&#x2014;you can't take it lightly. And there are weeks to go before summer, not days. You will go to school and that's that. Now go on upstairs, Tommy, take a bath and then get a little rest. I'm sure you didn't sleep much last night. There are clean towels in the closet, and you can have the guest room at the end of the hall. If you need anything, just ask. We'll talk some more later."<br><br>Tommy nodded and started out of the kitchen, then paused. "How come you're being so nice to me?"<br><br>For an instant he allowed her to see the vulnerable, lost little boy behind the defiant facade. "Because you're worth being nice to, Tommy Flanagan," she told him.<br><br>He seemed a bit startled by that, but he gave a little bob of his head and took off, thundering up the stairs, Molly trailing after him.<br><br>"And because I need you as much as you need me," she whispered when he was out of earshot.<br><br>Once again she reached for the phone and made the call to Frances.<br><br>"Oh, Daisy," the social worker murmured when she'd heard what Daisy had to say. "Are you sure you want to do this? Tommy's a real troublemaker. Not that it's not understandable, given what he's been through, but he needs a firm hand."<br><br>"He needs love," Daisy retorted. "And I intend to see that he gets it."<br><br>"But&#x2014;"<br><br>"Is there some reason I'm not a fit foster mother for him?" Daisy demanded.<br><br>"Of course not," Frances said, as if the very idea that someone would consider a Spencer unfit was ludicrous.<br><br>"Then that's that. Tommy stays here."<br><br>"Until I find a relative," the social worker reminded her.<br><br>"Or not," Daisy said. "You'll take care of the paperwork, then?"<br><br>Frances sighed. "I will. I'll drop it by later for you to sign, though I can't imagine what King is going to say when he hears about this."<br><br>"Then you be real sure not to tell him," Daisy retorted. "Or I'll make him think this was all your idea."<br><br>Frances was still sputtering over the threat when Daisy hung up. A little grin of satisfaction spread across her face. It was about time she gave the residents of Trinity Harbor something to talk about besides her long-ago broken engagement and her pecan pie.<br><br>"Sis, you are out of your ever-loving mind," her brother Tucker, the local sheriff, told Daisy when he arrived within an hour of her conversation with Frances.<br><br>Obviously the instant he'd heard what she was up to&#x2014;probably straight from the social worker&#x2014;Tucker had hightailed it over to lecture her as if she were sixteen instead of thirty. Hands on hips, he was scowling at her as if she'd committed some sort of crime, instead of simply seizing the opportunity that had been presented to her.<br><br>"That boy's going to land in juvenile detention," he declared in his best doom-and-gloom tone. "You mark my words. Doc's caught him stealing comic books. He broke Mrs. Thomas's window. And he rode his bike through Mr. Lindsey's bean patch and mowed down most of his plants. Something tells me that's just the things we know about. There could be more. He's headed for trouble, Daisy."<br><br>Daisy stared right straight back into Tucker's eyes, ignored his stony expression, and countered, "Well, of course he is...unless someone steps in and does something."<br><br>"And that has to be you?"<br><br>"Do you see anybody else who's willing?" she demanded. "He's already run through half the foster families in the area. As for those pranks of his, you and Bobby did worse and nobody did more than call Daddy to complain."<br><br>"That was different."<br><br>"How?"<br><br>Tucker squirmed uneasily. "It just was, that's all." He tried another tack. "When Dad hears about this, he is going to go ballistic."<br><br>She shrugged off her brother's assessment as if it was of no consequence. "Dad is always going ballistic about one thing or another. Usually it's you or Bobby who gets him all worked up. It's about time I took a turn. Being King Spencer's dutiful daughter is starting to wear thin."<br><br>"You'll get your heart broken," Tucker predicted, his expression worried. "You can't just take in some stray kid and decide to keep him. That's no way to get what you want, Sis."<br><br>Her big brother knew better than anyone how desperately she wanted a family. He had been the one to console her when Billy had walked out, leaving her convinced she would never marry. Even without knowing anything more than the fact that Billy was the one to break the engagement, Tucker had wanted to throttle the man. Daisy had persuaded him not to, assuring him that Billy Inscoe wasn't worth another second of their time, much less the risk of an assault charge that could ruin Tucker's career in law enforcement.<br><br>"Sooner or later, they'll find Tommy's family," Tucker warned, regarding her protectively.<br><br>"I don't know what makes you so certain of that," she said. "There's been no sign of anyone so far, and you know how dogged Frances is when she's working a case."<br><br>"That's exactly what makes me believe she'll eventually get results. When she does, you'll have to let him go."<br><br>"And until then, he'll have me," she insisted stubbornly, not wanting to consider what she would do when that day came.<br><br>"Where is he now?" Tucker asked.<br><br>"Upstairs."<br><br>"Cleaning out your jewelry box, no doubt."<br><br>She scowled. "Sleeping," she contradicted.<br><br>"Wanna bet? If I prove otherwise, will you forget about this?"<br><br></p><h2>Personal Hygiene? What&#39;s that Got to Do with Me?</h2><p>Personal Hygiene? What&#39;s that Got to Do with Me? is a curriculum developed for students with autism, Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, learning and developmental disabilities, designed to help them understand how others perceive their appearance and the social implications of neglecting personal hygiene.

Step-by-step cartoons explain exactly what the student needs to do to ensure good hygiene. Quizzes and activity pages provide numerous opportunities for repetition and reinforcement of the key points. There are also hands-on activities to demonstrate why and how to perform various hygiene tasks. Several social stories are also provided, along with a set of worksheets that help students set up a daily schedule to allow time for completing necessary hygiene tasks.</p><p>Pictures, quizzes and information to help children understand the importance of personal hygienePat Crissey has worked in the field of special education for over twenty years, as a special education teacher and autism consultant.

Charming works of elegant simplicity and warmth, they have become cornerstones of the piano repertoire, favorites of both amateur and professional musicians and their audiences.<br>This authoritative edition presents all 66 of these piano jewels in one finely made yet inexpensive volume. Although technically uncomplicated and reasonably easy to master, the Lyric Pieces evoke with startling freshness a wide emotional range, often bringing into play the varied moods and idioms of Norwegian folk music, an evergreen source of Grieg's inspiration. They vary in mood from the serene sadness of "Berceuse" and the nostalgic yearning of "To Spring" to the fanciful "Elves' Dance" and the joyful "Wedding Day at Troldhaugen."<br>In many passages, the music exhibits harmonies that were novel for the time &#x2014; harmonies recognizably late-romantic in style, but clearly anticipating the impressionism of Debussy, Ravel, and others. Pianists at every level of accomplishment will find this volume of delightful and moving works, reprinted here from the original editions published by C. F.

It marks a major accomplishment from a poet and performer who has inscribed her vision of our world in powerful anthems, ballads, and lyrics. In this intimate and searing collection of poems, Smith joins in that great tradition of troubadours, journeymen, wordsmiths, and artists who respond to the world around them in fresh and original language. Her influences are eclectic and striking: Blake, Rimbaud, Picasso, Arbus, and Johnny Appleseed. Smith is an American original; her poems are oracles for our times. </p></p><p><strong>Patti Smith</strong> is a writer, performer, and visual artist. She gained recognition in the 1970s for her revolutionary mergence of poetry and rock and was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. Her seminal album <em>Horses</em>, bearing Robert Mapplethorpe&#x2019;s renowned photograph, hasbeen hailed as one of the top one hundred albums of all time. Her books include <em>M Train</em>, <em>Witt</em>, <em>Babel</em>, <em>Woolgathering</em>, <em>The Coral Sea</em>, and <em>Auguries of Innocence</em>.Smith's fans remain legion; her 1975 album <i>Horses</i>, a masterpiece, continues to influence and inspire. Her writings, appearing over the years following the band's '80s dormancy, have garnered a cult following not unlike that of Charles Bukowski. The press chat quotes the following from a poem called "The Long Road": "We broke our mother's heart and became ourselves./ We proceeded to breathe and therefore to leave,/ drunken startled beings, each of us a god." It's hard to imagine those lines in a book published by Ecco without Smith to back them up. Yet they do convey what can only be called Smith's mystique, and the book as whole effectively transmits the affect and aura, as well as the innocence, that make her a rock star: one believes in her. There are better lines and poems among the 24 short lyrics (along with the long, diffuse "Birds of Iraq"); the book certainly eclipses, say, Billy Corgan's recent <i>Blinking with Fists</i>. There are more polished books of poems by bandleaders (David Berman's <i>Actual Air</i> and Jeff Tweedy's <i>Adult Head</i> come to mind), but these poems allow access to a major artist's thoughts and preoccupations. <i>(Oct. 11)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Fascial Distortion Model: A new paradigm for pain relief and restored movement</h2><p><i>Why Does It Hurt</i> presents a whole new viewpoint on the way our bodies work using FDM, the <i>Fascial Distortion Model,<i>. Fascia is the fibrous connective tissue that permeates our bodies and holds everything together. Distorted fascia is often the cause of pain that may not respond to traditional treatments of physical therapy or anti-inflammatory drugs. Thanks to FDM, patients stooped over from chronic back pain now stand straight, and athletes sidelined with sprains quickly return to the game and perform as if nothing happened. <i>Why Does It Hurt</i> explains how, in case after case, FDM dramatically shortens healing time, reduces the need for tests and drugs, and restores movement and well-being to patients who had given up hope.</i></i></p><p>Dr. Todd Capistrant is an osteopathic physician who has increasingly centered his practice on the Fascial Distortion Model. In addition to his busy osteopathic manipulative practice, he currently serves as the Chief Medical Officer for Tanana Valley Clinic/Banner Health in Fairbanks, Alaska. He is a board member of the AFDMA, and routinely engaged as one of its instructors to teach the FDM throughout the world. He also serves as a regional dean for Pacific Northwest University, an osteopathic medical school located in Yakima, Washington, bringing Alaskan osteopathic students back to Fairbanks for training. Todd lives near Denali National Park with his wife and two daughters who maintain a sled dog kennel and farm homestead. Both he and his wife have competed in and finished the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. He and his family enjoy being active outdoors and frequently can be found enjoying outdoor pursuits in Alaska and wherever their travels may take them. Steve LeBeau is a writer and editor based in St. Paul, Minnesota. He is a former journalist and was a speechwriter for Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.''FDM completely enhanced my athletic ability. Without the manipulations, my athletic career would be coming to an end. I've made gains I didn't think I was capable of before.'' --Erica Meckel, World Eskimo Indian Olympic and Arctic Winter Games Gold Medalist<p> ''Conditions that took weeks or months to improve now take two to four visits, sometimes one visit, with FDM. It's drastically reduced the number of injections I do, the number of consultations I order, and the number of trials of OMM. --Jose S. Figueroa, DO, Board Certified PM&amp;R, NMM/OMMPhysician, Clinician and Assistant Professor, OMM Dept., Des Moines University</p><p> ''This model of diagnosis and treatment finally gives the fascial system the attention it deserves. As the former dean of the Pacific Northwest University College of Osteopathic Medicine, the faculty and I were impressed with how quickly students grasp these concepts and utilize the skills that Dr. Capistrant shares in this engaging and informative book.'' -- --Robyn Phillips-Madson, DO, MPH, Founding Dean, University of the Incarnate Word School of Osteopathic Medicine, San Antonio, Texas</p></p><h2>On the Blue Comet</h2><p>"I love this book's lavish illustrations, which are interspersed throughout the book and add to the appeal of time-travelling into history.

She has a degree in children's literature from the University of Minnesota and teaches illustration and workshops on visual literacy. She lives with her husband and two children in St. Paul, Minnesota.This most recent addition to the Picture Book Biography series balances candor with discretion in its presentation of heroine Anne Frank. Adler traces the intersection of Anne's brief life with the forces of Nazism, chronicling the girl's earliest years in Germany as well as her time spent in the now-famous Amsterdam attic and the months following arrest and deportation. He refuses to apply the standard encomiums about his subject's courage and genius, with the result that Anne Frank emerges all the more poignantly. Like Adler, Ritz conveys more than familiar icons: she has executed black-and-white drawings closely based on the well-known extant photographs of Anne and her family and friends, and set these into watercolors of, for example, 1930s Germany or Anne packing her diary. Even her picture of shaven-headed, hollow-eyed Anne and Margot huddled together at Bergen-Belsen avoids cliche and condescension. "Some people find it difficult to understand the Holocaust," Adler concludes with grace. "But when they read Anne's diary, it all becomes real. Then they know one of the victims. They know Anne Frank."

Through extensive ethnographic fieldwork in Mumbai's settlements, Anand found that Mumbai's water flows, not through a static collection of pipes and valves, but through a dynamic infrastructure built on the relations between residents, plumbers, politicians, engineers, and the 3,000 miles of pipe that bind them. In addition to distributing water, the public water network often reinforces social identities and the exclusion of marginalized groups, as only those actively recognized by city agencies receive legitimate water services. This form of recognition&#x2014;what Anand calls "hydraulic citizenship"&#x2014;is incremental, intermittent, and reversible. It provides residents an important access point through which they can make demands on the state for other public services such as sanitation and education. Tying the ways Mumbai's poorer residents are seen by the state to their historic, political, and material relations with water pipes, the book highlights the critical role infrastructures play in consolidating civic and social belonging in the city.</p><p>Nikhil Anand is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania."This book is a fine intervention in anthropology, geography and sociology, as it troubles not just conventional understandings of how urban fragmentation works but is also an example of engaging creatively with socio-material assemblages and processes governing everyday life in the city.&nbsp; . . .

(Sneha Annavarapu <i>International Journal of Urban and Regional Research</i> 2017-09-01)<br><br>"Using a rich, empirically grounded approach, Anand makes a major contribution to the existing literature on water services, citizenship and difference. . . .

It is a work that nimbly shifts between scales and time, moving between historic narratives of installing the public water system and everyday experiences of gathering water. . . . Rife with fluidity and movement . . . This is a book that has a broad appeal that cuts across disciplinary boundaries." (Chitra Venkataramani <i>Asian Journal of Social Science</i> 2019-03-12)<br><br>"Anand proficiently merges theories of infrastructure and citizenship to explain the uncertainty surrounding water in Mumbai. Thanks to his clear writing and evocative ethnographic story-telling, readers can gain a solid social and technical understanding of the leaking leviathan of Mumbai . . .

The cases illustrate the principles and techniques of the respective approaches and allow the reader to "listen in" on highly skilled therapists at work. Editor Frank Dattilio comments on each case with a focus on ways to integrate systemic and cognitive-behavioral approaches. He suggests ways that cognitive principles might usefully be called upon at specific points. Responses from contributors consider the benefits of Dattilio's suggestions and elucidate each practitioner's decision-making process.<br>&nbsp;<br>See also Dattilio's authored book, <i>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy with Couples and Families</i>, which combines the empirical research base with practical clinical guidance.</p><p></p></p><p>&nbsp;Frank M.

Dattilio has edited a superb volume of marital and family therapy cases treated by an impressive array of prominent family therapists. A unique feature of this book is the editor's comments on each case, attempting to find areas of commonality between cognitive-behavioral therapy and the other approaches. This unparalleled, sophisticated attempt to integrate the various therapy models advances a step in the development of a broad model for the treatment of relationships." --James L. Framo, PhD, Distinguished Professor, United States International University<br><br>"Dattilio has put together a book that leaps forward in the search for some integration in therapeutic models, particularly with couples and families.

This is a book for today's theoreticians, teachers, and clinicians." --Harry J. Aponte, ACSW <br><br>"What a treat! And what a pleasant way to learn: The reader gets excellent case histories by first-rate family therapists, interlaced with the comments of a masterful cognitive therapist.

Utilizing the concise, scenario-driven style pioneered in Scott Meyers's best-selling <i>Effective C++</i>, Brett Slatkin brings together 59 Python best practices, tips, shortcuts, and realistic code examples from expert programmers.<br> <br>Through realistic examples, Slatkin uncovers little-known Python quirks, intricacies, and idioms that powerfully impact code behavior and performance. You'll learn how to choose the most efficient and effective way to accomplish key tasks when multiple options exist, and how to write code that's easier to understand, maintain, and improve.<br> <br>Drawing on his deep understanding of Python's capabilities, Slatkin offers practical advice for each major area of development with both Python 3.x and Python 2.x. Coverage includes:<br> <ul> <li>Algorithms</li> <li>Objects</li> <li>Concurrency</li> <li>Collaboration</li> <li>Built-in modules</li> <li>Production techniques</li> <li>And more</li> </ul> Each section contains specific, actionable guidelines organized into items, each with carefully worded advice supported by detailed technical arguments and illuminating examples. Using <b>Effective Python</b>, you can systematically improve all the Python code you write: not by blindly following rules or mimicking incomprehensible idioms, but by gaining a deep understanding of the technical reasons why they make sense.</p><p>Brett Slatkin is a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google.

This is perhaps the leading division within the psychological study of politics today. <i>Political Psychology: Situations, Individuals, and Cases, 2nd edition,</i> provides a concise, readable, and conceptually organized introduction to the topic of political psychology by examining this very question. Using this situationism--dispositionism framework&#x2015;which roughly parallels the concerns of social and cognitive psychology&#x2015;this book focuses on such key explanatory mechanisms as behaviorism, obedience, personality, groupthink, cognition, affect, emotion, and neuroscience to explore topics ranging from voting behavior and racism to terrorism and international relations. The new edition includes a new chapter on the psychology of the media and communication. Houghton has also updated the text to analyze recent political events such as the 2012 election, and to include up-and-coming research in the areas of neuroscience, behavioral economics, and more. Houghton's clear and engaging examples directly challenge students to place themselves in both real and hypothetical situations which involve intense moral and political dilemmas.

This volume stresses the dynamic quality of Mughal territorial expansion, their institutional innovations in land revenue, coinage and military organization, ideological change and the relationship between the emperors and Islam.The Mughal empire was one of the largest centralized states known in pre-modern world history. It was founded in the early 1500s and by the end of the following century the Mughal emperor ruled almost the entire Indian subcontinent with a population of between 100 and 150 millions. As well as military success, the Mughal emperors displayed immense wealth and the ceremonies, etiquette, music, poetry, and exquisitely executed paintings and objects of the imperial court fused together to create a distinctive aristocratic high culture. In this volume, Professor John Richards traces the history of this magnificent empire from its creation in 1526 to its breakup in 1720. He stresses the dynamic quality of Mughal territorial expansion, their institutional innovation in land revenue, coinage and military organization, ideological change, and the relationship between the emperors and Islam. Professor Richards also analyzes institutions particular to the Mughal empire, such as the jagir system, and explores Mughal India&#39;s links with the early modern world. The Mughal Empire offers a concise and up-to-date synthesis of this spectacular period in the history of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It will be widely read by students and specialists of South Asian history and civilization and will be of interest to travellers wishing to know more about the background to the great Mughal monuments.</p><h2>Oxford Bookworms Library Factfiles: Level 4:: The History of the English Language (Oxford Bookworms Library Factfiles)</h2><p>Features <strong>topics</strong> such as environmental issues, historical facts, and culture.<br><br><strong>Full-color</strong> photographs, introductions, glossaries, and exercises enhance student reading and learning.<br><br><strong>Audio</strong> versions of selected titles provide great models of intonation and pronunciation of difficult words.<br></p><p>Christine Lindop was born in New Zealand where she began her teaching career.

Patel challenges the widespread belief that music and language are processed independently. Since Plato's time, the relationship between music and language has attracted interest and debate from a wide range of thinkers. Recently, scientific research on this topic has been growing rapidly, as scholars from diverse disciplines, including linguistics, cognitive science, music cognition, and neuroscience are drawn to the music-language interface as one way to explore the extent to which different mental abilities are processed by separate brain mechanisms. Accordingly, the relevant data and theories have been spread across a range of disciplines. This volume provides the first synthesis, arguing that music and language share deep and critical connections, and that comparative research provides a powerful way to study the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying these uniquely human abilities.<br><br>Winner of the 2008 ASCAP Deems Taylor Award.<br></p><p><br>Aniruddh D. Patel is past president of the Society for Music Perception and Cognition and is a Professor in the Department of Psychology at Tufts University.<br>" A major synthesis that will be indispensable to neuroscientists, and a thought-provoking and illuminating exploration of the mental and neural foundations of music and language for anyone interested in the human brain."--Oliver Sacks<br>"This book is an intellectual tour de force, raising many more issues than recent popular works...Patel offers a thorough analysis of music cognition and its relation to language, and outlines an ambitious and innovative research programme that deepens our understanding of cognition in general...A work of exceptional scholarship and clarity."--Nature<br>"This book is a fabulous guide to what can sometimes be an inaccessible body of literature. Although popular books on this subject abound, Patel has provided an up-to-date and authoritative academic treatment...Music, Language, and the Brain is an impressive feat of scholarship and comes highly recommended."--Nature Neuroscience<br>"Patel's dissection of the multiple components of language and music cognition is elegant and deeply knowledgeable. His writing achieves a masterly balance. On the one hand he is bold and creative in uncovering and explaining important phenomena that link language and music. On the other hand he displays true scientific humility in refusing to speculate too far beyond the known facts. In a subject area prone to superficiality and overstatement, Patel is a sure and trustworthy guide for how to make real progress in understanding these complex but fascinating phenomena."--John Sloboda, Professor of Psychology, Keele University<br>"This book will be required reading for specialists, and interesting and informative reading for everyone. It manages to combine remarkable breadth of coverage with genuine depth of understanding, and it's clearly and elegantly written. The author has a clear point of view and wants to get it across to other researchers, but never lets that get in the way of the book's more fundamental goal of putting the latest research within the reach of the interested non-specialist reader."--D.R. Ladd, Professor of Linguistics, University of Edinburgh<br>"Reading Patel's Music, Language, and the Brain is a deeply rewarding experience. The question of whether parallels exist between music and language has until now been a question of wide interest and speculation. This landmark monograph provides a detailed and informed framework for examining this question scientifically. The presentation presumes no prior specialized knowledge and offers clear explanations of the technical ideas necessary inspiring agenda for future research, ranging from intriguing speculations to carefully-worked out experimental designs.Music, Language, and the Brain will shape and inform research on the relationship between music and language for decades to come."--Carol L. Krumhansl, Prof. of Psychology, Cornell University<br>"...a wide-ranging, well-researched and highly readable exploration...Patel's book is the most scholarly and comprehensive account of the topic yet published. It should be of special interest not only to music psychologists and phonologists but also to other linguists who want to expand their horizons."--Trends in Cognitive Sciences<br>"Written by a first-rate scientist, Music, Language and the Brain is the most comprehensive and clear treatment of the sometimes patchwork body of knowledge exploring music and language comparisons within music psychology and neuroscience. Patel's book makes an immediate and important contribution to the vast array of literature in this area by bringing it together in a single source. It is all the more impressive because of the author's ability to present this complex web of scholarship in a very logical and highly readable style...I am certain I will find myself returning to this resource many times."--Steven M. Demorest for Empirical Musicology Review<br>"The book is dense, but not heavy, clear but not simple, rich but not arrogant. It is the type of book that needs to be discussed with other people, to savor, sip by sip, like a 10-year old Bourgogne."--Music Perception<br>"What's great about this volume is that it provides an all-in-one compendium of a huge amount of information, nicely organized, with appropriate illustrations, and lavishly referenced throughout...Overall, this is a highly recommended read. It is stimulating and wide-ranging and contains material that readers of many backgrounds and levels will find interesting."--Neuron<br>"Aniruddh Patel's book, Music, Language and the Brain, manages to be both admirably readable and also scholarly. Whilst there are other books dealing rigorously with the perceptual and cognitive aspects of language and music as separate topics, few, if any, authors have successfully tackled the task of exploring the overlap between the cognitive and neural mechanisms of these two uniquely human domains. Patel takes on the challenge of providing not only accurate coverage of exisiting research in the fields of language and music, but also a much needed synthesis that throws new light on the links between the two....Patel's research ideas could keep a battalion of investigators busy for the next decade.... It sets a gold standard for authors aiming to write a wide-ranging, yet not over-technical book which is comprehensible and without having sacrificed intellectual integrity in the search for glib generalizations."--Brain<br>"A scientific tour de force.... Monumental in scope and in proportion, the value of this volume as an academic resource is immense. A vast amount of research is packed into its 513 pages and Patel demonstrates perspicacity and clarity of expression throughout... Music, Language, and the Brain makes a profound scientific contribution to the study of music and language...no other single source equips readers more thoroughly to explore the cognitive intersection between these two domains."--Psychology of Music<br>"...Music, Language and the Brain reaches far and ranges wide, its themes and arguments irreducible to the sum of prior formulations on the "music of language" and the "language of music." Seldom does one encounter so voluminous a repertory of empirical evidence so deftly marshaled by so communicative an intellect."--Notes<br>"....this book is an accessible and invaluable resource....In an age of lip service to interdisciplinarity, Patel rolls up his sleeves and starts building bridges, not just among the subdisciplines of cognitive science, but also between the science and humanities. I recommend this book enthusiastically as a guide to language and music in the brain and mind, and as a model of integrative thinking."--Reviewed by Daniel Casasanto, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, in Language and Cognition<br>The strength of Patel's book is its ability to provide in-depth studies of music and linguistic cognition in a manner that illustrates both their interconnectedness and their differences. Any student of music theory would benefit from Patel's explanations of mental processing of music and its theoretical foundations; any student of linguistic theory would benefit from his neurological analogies. As the study of music cognition continues to grow, the present work will become an increasingly important resource."--Music Theory Online<br>"Music, Language, and the Brain provides a fascinating synopsis of the current, young state of scientific research in cross-domain language--music comparative study. The book traverses with ease the disciplinary lines of linguistics, music and neuroscience. This impressive work of scholarship will serve as a reference on the topics for years to come."-Phonology<br><br></p><h2>The Power of Black Music: Interpreting Its History from Africa to the United States</h2><p>When Jimi Hendrix transfixed the crowds of Woodstock with his gripping version of "The Star Spangled Banner," he was building on a foundation reaching back, in part, to the revolutionary guitar playing of Howlin' Wolf and the other great Chicago bluesmen, and to the Delta blues tradition before him. But in its unforgettable introduction, followed by his unaccompanied "talking" guitar passage and inserted calls and responses at key points in the musical narrative, Hendrix's performance of the national anthem also hearkened back to a tradition even older than the blues, a tradition rooted in the rings of dance, drum, and song shared by peoples across Africa. <br> <br> Bold and original, <em>The Power of Black Music</em> offers a new way of listening to the music of black America, and appreciating its profound contribution to all American music. Striving to break down the barriers that remain between high art and low art, it brilliantly illuminates the centuries-old linkage between the music, myths and rituals of Africa and the continuing evolution and enduring vitality of African-American music. Inspired by the pioneering work of Sterling Stuckey and Henry Louis Gates, Jr., author Samuel A. Floyd, Jr, advocates a new critical approach grounded in the forms and traditions of the music itself. He accompanies readers on a fascinating journey from the African ring, through the ring shout's powerful merging of music and dance in the slave culture, to the funeral parade practices of the early new Orleans jazzmen, the bluesmen in the twenties, the beboppers in the forties, and the free jazz, rock, Motown, and concert hall composers of the sixties and beyond. Floyd dismisses the assumption that Africans brought to the United States as slaves took the music of whites in the New World and transformed it through their own performance practices. Instead, he recognizes European influences, while demonstrating how much black music has continued to share with its African counterparts. Floyd maintains that while African Americans may not have direct knowledge of African traditions and myths, they can intuitively recognize links to an authentic African cultural memory. For example, in speaking of his grandfather Omar, who died a slave as a young man, the jazz clarinetist Sidney Bechet said, "Inside him he'd got the memory of all the wrong that's been done to my people. That's what the memory is....When a blues is good, that kind of memory just grows up inside it." <br>Grounding his scholarship and meticulous research in his childhood memories of black folk culture and his own experiences as a musician and listener, Floyd maintains that the memory of Omar and all those who came before and after him remains a driving force in the black music of America, a force with the power to enrich cultures the world over.<br></p><p>Bold and original, &#39;The Power of Black Music&#39; offers a new way of listening to the music of black America and appreciating its profound contribution to all American music.

Taxes arouse strong passions, fueled not only by conflicts of economic self-interest, but by conflicting ideas of fairness. Taking as a guiding principle the conventional nature of private property, Murphy and Nagel show how taxes can only be evaluated as part of the overall system of property rights that they help to create. Justice or injustice in taxation, they argue, can only mean justice or injustice in the system of property rights and entitlements that result from a particular regime. Taking up ethical issues about individual liberty, interpersonal obligation, and both collective and personal responsibility, Murphy and Nagel force us to reconsider how our tax policy shapes our system of property rights.<br></p><p><br><strong>Liam Murphy</strong> teaches law and philosophy at New York University.

Among other controversies, the authors delve into the sociopolitical aspects of grammar rules, the subjectivity of pet peeves and grammar police, the changing ways grammar has been taught, and how assessment and a changing educational climate has influenced this. They also lay out the fascinating history of the linguistic tradition, from the Sanskrit grammar of Panini (c. 520-460 BCE), sometimes considered a founder of linguistics, to the ancient Greeks, the development of the Western tradition, and through the rise of &#x2019;correct&#x2019; English grammar in the 17th century to the present day.<br> <br> <i>Navigating English Grammar</i> is an engaging and fresh take on the rules and the politics of English grammar, written in lively, inviting prose.<p><b>Anne Lobeck</b> is Professor of English and Linguistics at Western Washington University.

Through a thorough review of the relevant literature on opioid management, it seeks to distill and present the information and controversy about a challenging subject via a simplified, accessible tool. As the book espouses, good, effective, and safe pain management is a basic human right that practitioners struggle to achieve for their patients, given its complex blend of art and science. To have a resource that brings clarity to the approach and mechanics of opioid dosing is welcome. The book succeeds and its compellingfeature is its pedagogical approach to meet these objectives.&nbsp;<b>Audience</b>It is intended as an ongoing resource for healthcare providers who need to navigate the art and science of pain management in the safest, most effective manner. Through a thorough review of the relevant literature on opioid management, it seeks to distill and present the information and controversy about a challenging subject via a simplified, accessible tool. As the book espouses, good, effective, and safe pain management is a basic human right that practitioners struggle to achieve for their patients, given its complex blend of art and science. To have a resource that brings clarity to the approach and mechanics of opioid dosing is welcome. The book succeeds and its compellingfeature is its pedagogical approach to meet these objectives.&nbsp;<b>Features</b>The book focuses on the important basic mathematical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and patient parameters that a practitioner must understand in order to safely and successfully transition patients between opioid regimens as their pain management needs change. Through tables, patient scenarios, and practice problems with explanations, the book succeeds in helping readers to not only digest and synthesize the information, but most importantly, apply what they are learning. Therapeutic pearls and pitfalls offer the basic information an additional nuance and value. Added features that make the book even more user friendly are statements of learning objectives for each chapter, a basic glossary, and an appendix of the available dosage formulations. If the book could use any enhancement, it would be its physical size. A continually accessible information resource for a practitioner is better when it is more portable, so a pocket-sized version of the book, perhaps with some abridging,would make it an ideal resource.&nbsp;<b>Assessment</b>This will undoubtedly be a useful tool for healthcare providers seeking to accurately and safely achieve their patients' pain management goals. What stands out is the high caliber of the quality of the teaching. The patient cases are well conceived, and the practice problems reinforce what is being taught. Because it easily can be referenced and applied to actual patient scenarios, the book is an excellent ongoing useful resource.&nbsp;<b>Weighted Numerical Score:</b> 91 - 4 Stars!<br> (Dennis K Constan, PharmD <i>MedInfoNow</i> 2010-03-01)</p><h2>Ten Great Ideas about Chance</h2><p><p><b>A fascinating account of the breakthrough ideas that transformed probability and statistics</b></p><p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, gamblers and mathematicians transformed the idea of chance from a mystery into the discipline of probability, setting the stage for a series of breakthroughs that enabled or transformed innumerable fields, from gambling, mathematics, statistics, economics, and finance to physics and computer science. This book tells the story of ten great ideas about chance and the thinkers who developed them, tracing the philosophical implications of these ideas as well as their mathematical impact.</p><p>Persi Diaconis and Brian Skyrms begin with Gerolamo Cardano, a sixteenth-century physician, mathematician, and professional gambler who helped develop the idea that chance actually can be measured. They describe how later thinkers showed how the judgment of chance also can be measured, how frequency is related to chance, and how chance, judgment, and frequency could be unified. Diaconis and Skyrms explain how Thomas Bayes laid the foundation of modern statistics, and they explore David Hume&#x2019;s problem of induction, Andrey Kolmogorov&#x2019;s general mathematical framework for probability, the application of computability to chance, and why chance is essential to modern physics. A final idea&#x2015;that we are psychologically predisposed to error when judging chance&#x2015;is taken up through the work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.</p><p>Complete with a brief probability refresher, <i>Ten Great Ideas about Chance </i>is certain to be a hit with anyone who wants to understand the secrets of probability and how they were discovered.</p></p><p><p>"In this attractively written book, which is rigorous yet informal, Persi Diaconis and Brian Skyrms dispel the confusion about chance and randomness. They range from coin tosses to particle physics and show how chance and probability baffled the best minds for centuries. I cannot imagine a more accessible account of these deep and difficult ideas."<b>--Jon Elster, Columbia University and Coll�ge de France</b></p><p>"There is something fundamentally paradoxical about probability theory, as a mathematical language for saying precisely what we do not know. In this book, an eminent philosopher and mathematician guide us through the resolution of these paradoxes, to offer a deeper understanding of how we can analyze problems of uncertainty in the world."<b>--Roger Myerson, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"One should add an eleventh great idea to <i>Ten Great Ideas about Chance</i> namely, for probabilist, statistician, and magician Persi Diaconis and philosopher of science Brian Skyrms to write a book about the subject! This fascinating book mingles the foundations of probability with history and philosophy, covering topics that include the uncertain and elusive notion of inference, and bringing forth a broad and powerful vision of concepts that should appeal to both specialists and general science readers."<b>--Christian P. Robert, Universit� Paris-Dauphine and University of Warwick</b></p><p>"This wonderful book looks at both the nature of probability and the history of thinking on the subject, following a path that goes from coin-flipping machines to quantum physics via psychology and behavioral economics.

Industrialization, mass immigration, the growing presence of women in the work force, and the rapid advance of the cities had transformed American society. <br><br>Broad in scope, The Gilded Age brings together sixteen original essays that offer lively syntheses of modern scholarship while making their own interpretive arguments. These engaging pieces allow students to consider the various societal, cultural and political factors that make studying the Gilded Age crucial to our understanding of America today. Charles W. Calhoun connects all of these essays with a comprehensive introduction that places each article in an understandable historical context. For the second edition of this successful book, each essay was revised and three new pieces have been added that explore technology, consumerism, intellectual life, and race in late nineteenth century America.</p><p>Charles W.

The only truly comprehensive study in English of the Tokugawa period, it also introduces a new ecological perspective, covering natural disasters, resource use, demographics, and river control.</p><p>This highly readable book offers a rich narrative of Japan&#39;s early modern - or Tokugawa - period (1568-1868). Drawing on an extensive body of scholarship, Totman weaves together political, economic, intellectual, literary and cultural history with imagination and skill, making this the only truly comprehensive and up to date study in English of these three centuries of Japanese history. The author broadens the context still further by bringing a unique ecological perspective to his subject, examining such topics as natural disasters, resource use and depletion, demographics, and river control. The book begins with the story of a century and a half of extraordinary growth that culminated in the urban cultural blossoming of the Genroku period (roughly 1680 to 1710). It then traces the complex pattern of political, cultural, and more fundamental environmental developments that brought Japan through the harsh decades of the eighteenth century into a period of renewed social and cultural dynamism in the 1790s. Finally, it follows the growing entanglement of these domestic trends and surging Euro-American imperialist activity that led to the Meiji Restoration and Japan&#39;s move into an era of active global engagement. Recognizing that Eurasian political boundaries are again in flux, the author devotes considerable attention to Japan&#39;s international relations during the decades after 1792 when its boundaries with Russia were gradually clarified. Totman enlivens his book throughout with biographical detail, forthright interpretation, and frequent quotations from primary sources. The extraordinary breadth of his sources and his remarkable ability to bring them together in a clear and engagingnarrative promise to make Early Modern Japan the standard work on the subject for years to come.<b>Conrad Totman</b> is Professor of History at Yale University and the author of <i>Japan Before Perry: A Short History</i> (California, 1981) and <i>The Green Archipelago: Forestry in Pre-Industrial Japan</i> (California, 1989).</p><h2>The 99 Percent Economy: How Democratic Socialism Can Overcome the Crises of Capitalism (Clarendon Lectures in Management Studies)</h2><p>We live in a time of crises - economic turmoil, workplace disempowerment, unresponsive government, environmental degradation, social disintegration, and international rivalry. In <em>The 99 Percent Economy</em>, Paul S. Adler, a leading expert on business management, argues that these crises are destined to deepen unless we radically transform our economy. <br><br>But despair is not an option, and Adler provides a compelling alternative: democratic socialism. He argues that to overcome these crises we need to assert democratic control over the management of both individual enterprises and the entire national economy. To show how that would work, he draws on a surprising source of inspiration: the strategic management processes of many of our largest corporations. In these companies, the strategy process promises to involve and empower workers and to ensure efficiency and innovation. In practice, this promise is rarely realized, but in principle, that process could be consolidated within enterprises and it could be scaled-up to the national level. <br><br>Standing in the way? Private ownership of society's productive resources, which is the foundation of capitalism's ruthless competition and focus on private gain at the cost of society, the environment, and future generations. Adler shows how socialized, public ownership of our resources will enable democratic councils at the local and national levels to decide on our economic, social, and environmental goals and on how to reach them. The growing concentration of industry makes this socialization step ever easier. <br><br>Democratic socialism is not a leap into the unknown, Adler shows. Capitalist industry has built the foundations for a world beyond capitalism and its crises.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul S. Adler</strong> is the Harold Quinton Chair of Business Policy, and Professor of Management and Organization, Environmental Studies, and Sociology at the University of Southern California. In 2014-15, he served as President of the Academy of Management, the leading organization of management scholars.<br><br>"From Bernie Sanders to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, candidates who call themselves socialists are winning more elections and wielding wider influence. Paul Adler's timely new book helps us imagine what a political economy, based on socialist ideas, might actually look like and how it might operate for the benefit of millions of Americans who are not well-served by our current system. The 99 Percent Economy is not just a compelling indictment of capitalism run amuck. Adler makes a clear and convincing case for economic planning, expanded public investment, and greater social ownership and democratic management of productive enterprises. His book will be an essential educational tool for activists in labor and on the left." -- Steve Early, Former International Representative for the Communications Workers of America and author of Refinery Town: Big Oil, Big Money, and the Remaking of an American City<p></p><br>"Lucidly written and powerfully argued. Rarely do we get insight into the opportunities a truly democratic socialist economy might offer from an expert who knows how decisions are really made in leading corporations and large institutions. A must read for anyone interested in the creation of a progressive future." -- Gar Alperovitz, Author of America Beyond Capitalism and CoFounder of The Democracy Collaborative<p></p><br>"Paul Adler asks whether society can be reorganized for the benefit of its majority, that is, help those regularly disempowered? His book, <em>The 99 Percent Economy</em> begins with a radical premise that the economy should serve the vast majority rather than the other way around. Adler asks us to engage in a discussion about a different future that can move humanity away from the abyss and in the direction of a socialism that is democratic, radical, and visionary." -- Bill Fletcher, Jr., Former president of TransAfrica Forum; writer and labor activist<p></p><br></p><h2>Multicultural Law Enforcement: Strategies for Peacekeeping in a Diverse Society (What&#39;s New in Criminal Justice)</h2><p><p> <i>For courses covering multicultural issues in law enforcement.<br> </i> <b> <br>A classic text in peacekeeping, cultural awareness, and diversity in law enforcement<br> </b> <b> <i>Multicultural Law Enforcement: Strategies for Peacekeeping in a Diverse Society</i> </b> provides practical information and insight to prepare officers for culturally sensitive policing.

Ingram also has added much important material on cultural considerations. The method that is described allows the clinician to approach each patient with a carefully thought out treatment plan. By taking existential and spiritual concerns into account, it goes well beyond the usual problem centered approaches. I am happy to recommend it to all practitioners."<br> &#x2015;<b>George Stricker</b>, Professor of Psychology, Argosy University, Washington DC</p> <p>"Two major splits dominate the field of psychotherapy today: alienation between researchers and practitioners, and the fragmentation of theoretical approaches into self-contained, frequently warring subgroups. In this contentious environment, Ingram's important book is a wonderful breath of fresh air, for she develops a dramatically successful conceptual and practical model for bridging these splits. Her approach masterfully does this first by developing a generic case formulation paradigm that is both theory and data friendly for researchers, and individual-case friendly for practitioners. Second, in a far-ranging and seamless integration of the field, Ingram demonstrates how her case formulation model can incorporate concepts and principles from a wide variety of theoretical orientations, vividly showing how the different approaches can provide complementary perspectives on the same case. This complementarily in turn provides more options for treatment planning and intervention so as to best shape the therapy to the specific clinical needs and contexts of the individual client, while at the same time providing rich material to facilitate the further development and refinement of the theories."<br> &#x2015;<b>Daniel B.

"How hauntingly beautiful, how replete with lost possibilities, seems that Southern California of two and three generations ago, now that a dramatically diferent society has emerged in its place," writes Starr.<br><br>As he recreates the "lost California," Starr examines the rich variety of elements that figured in the growth of the Southern California way of life: the Spanish/Mexican roots, the fertile land, the Mediterranean-like climate, the special styles in architecture, the rise of Hollywood. He gives us a broad array of engaging (and often eccentric) characters: from Harrision Gray Otis to Helen Hunt Jackson to Cecil B. DeMille. Whether discussing the growth of winemaking or the burgeoning of reform movements, Starr keeps his central theme in sharp focus: how Californians defined their identity to themselves and to the nation.<br><br></p><p>California seems to have been the source of almost every cultural trend that defines modern America--often in contradictory ways. Consider the waves of conservative and progressive politics, self-love and selflessness, sushi and Big Macs, great literature, and banal films. <i>Inventing the Dream</i> traces this extraordinary state through the early years of the 20th century, when Americans began to flock westward and Los Angeles grew from a town of 50,000 to a large city of 320,000 in justa couple of decades. By 1926, Starr writes, Hollywood was the United States' fifth-largest industry, grossing $1.5 billion a year and accounting for 90 percent of the world's films--and, of course, changing the values of whole cultures. This is a fine work of historical reconstruction, joining Starr's other well-regarded works of Californiana.15 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Blessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel</h2><p>How have millions of American Christians come to measure spiritual progress in terms of their financial status and physical well-being? How has the movement variously called Word of Faith, Health and Wealth, Name It and Claim It, or simply prosperity gospel come to dominate much of our contemporary religious landscape?<br><br>Kate Bowler's <em>Blessed </em>is the first book to fully explore the origins, unifying themes, and major figures of a burgeoning movement that now claims millions of followers in America. Bowler traces the roots of the prosperity gospel: from the touring mesmerists, metaphysical sages, pentecostal healers, business oracles, and princely prophets of the early 20th century; through mid-century positive thinkers like Norman Vincent Peale and revivalists like Oral Roberts and Kenneth Hagin; to today's hugely successful prosperity preachers. Bowler focuses on such contemporary figures as Creflo Dollar, pastor of Atlanta's 30,000-member World Changers Church International; Joel Osteen, known as "the smiling preacher," with a weekly audience of seven million; T. D. Jakes, named by <em>Time</em> magazine one of America's most influential new religious leaders; Joyce Meyer, evangelist and women's empowerment guru; and many others. At almost any moment, day or night, the American public can tune in to these preachers-on TV, radio, podcasts, and in their megachurches-to hear the message that God desires to bless them with wealth and health. Bowler offers an interpretive framework for scholars and general readers alike to understand the diverse expressions of Christian abundance as a cohesive movement bound by shared understandings and common goals.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kate Bowler</strong> is Assistant Professor of American Religion at Duke Divinity School.<br><br>"[A] magnificent study."--<em>Heath W. Carter, Journal of Cultural Economy<p></p></em><br>"Highly entertaining...and deeply human."--David F. Ruccio, <em>Journal of Cultural Economy</em><p></p><br>"Very readable and engaging...<em>Blessed</em> is the best history of the development of the prosperity gospel written to date. It is an important addition to the library of pastors or scholars who regularly encounter the prosperity gospel in their ministry."--<em>Southwestern Journal of Theology</em><p></p><br>"Bowler shows how the prosperity gospel movement has drawn from multiple denominational, racial, ethnic, and even secular subtraditions. She identifies both the dazzling diversity and the common understandings that have given the prosperity gospel coherence" <br>--<em>Christian Century</em><p></p><br>"Bowler's respect for her subjects and her ability to locate them in the larger American religious narrative mean that serious scholars dismiss the prosperity gospel at their own peril. Bowler shows us that its deep roots and vibrant future, even after the recent recession, place it solidly in the category of religious movements to watch." --<em>Church History</em><p></p><br>"Marvelous this is a stunningly empathetic book. By pushing far beyond caricature, Bowler has produced a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the prosperity gospel and how it is, even now, remaking the American religious landscape." --<em>The Christian Century</em><p></p><br>"An important account of an audacious contemporary religious phenomenon." --<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"[A] riveting historical account." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"The 'prosperity gospel' is as much despised by its detractors as it is embraced by its millions of adherents. Yet until Kate Bowler's <em>Blessed</em>, no one has attempted a balanced, informative, inquisitive survey. Her book is a metaphorical godsend for those with an outsider's curiosity about one of the fastest growing religious movements in contemporary America and a literal one for those inside." -- Mark A. Noll, author of <em>Protestantism: A Very Short Introduction</em> <br><p></p><br>"Though often maligned and misunderstood, Bowler's comprehensive and exciting examination of the prosperity gospel demonstrates the ways 'health and wealth' has been a staple of American Protestant life since the 19th century. <em>Blessed</em> provides a thorough and nuanced account of the phenomenon, as it skillfully examines varying attitudes toward prosperity which emerged across racial, regional, and denominational lines. This is a grand contribution to the field of American religious history." -- Jonathan L. Walton, Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Professor of Religion and Society, Harvard University<p></p><br>"This book propels Kate Bowler into the first rank of younger historians of religion in America. The author's keen ear, her perceptive insights, and her command of history make this a remarkable and unforgettable book-and her conclusion that the 'prosperity gospel consecrated America's culture of optimism' rings very true." -- Randall Balmer, author of <em>Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory: A Journey into the Evangelical Subculture in America</em><p></p><br>"<em>Blessed</em> is worthwhile reading for what it is-a history of the prosperity gospel and not a theology of the prosperity movement. I've benefited from time spent working through it and would recommend it to those seeking to learn about this topic." --<em>The Gospel Coalition</em><p></p><br>"<em>Blessed</em> is a good history of the rise and flourishing of the gospel." --<em>The Blade</em><p></p><br>"...[A]n unprecedented historical examination of health and wealth as spiritual subjects in American Christianity by tracing the rise, development, and transformation of the prosperity gospel in the United States." --<em>Religious Studies Review</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to John Calvin (Cambridge Companions to Religion)</h2><p>An international array of major Calvin scholars considers aspects of Calvin&#39;s theological thought and influence.

In <em>German Literature: A Very Short Introduction</em>, Nicholas Boyle illuminates the particular character and power of German literature and explores its impact on the larger cultural world. Boyle presents an engrossing tour of German literature from the Middle Ages to the 20th century, focussing especially on the last 250 years. He examines key themes like idealism, modernism, materialism, trauma and memory, showing how they have imbued the great German writers with such distinctive voices.

Francis J. Bremer discusses the rise of Puritanism in the English Reformation, the struggle of the reformers to purge what they viewed as the corruptions of Roman Catholicism from the Elizabethan church, and the struggle with the Stuart monarchs that led to a brief Puritan triumph under Oliver Cromwell. It also examines the effort of Puritans who left England to establish a godly kingdom in America. Bremer examines puritan theology, views on family and community, their beliefs about the proper relationship between religion and public life, the limits of toleration, the balance between individual rights and one's obligation to others, and the extent to which public character should be shaped by private religious belief.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

He examines imperfect competition, offshoring, political economy, multinationals, endogenous growth, the gravity equation, and the organization of the firm in international trade. Feenstra also includes a new chapter on monopolistic competition with heterogeneous firms, with many applications of that model. In addition to known results, the book looks at some particularly important unpublished results by various authors. Two appendices draw on index numbers and discrete choice models to describe methods applicable to research problems in international trade.</p><p>Completely revised with the latest developments and brand-new materials, <i>Advanced International Trade </i>is a classic textbook that will be used widely by students and practitioners of economics for a long time to come.<br></p><ul><li>Updated second edition of the essential graduate textbook</li><li>Current approaches and a new chapter on monopolistic competition with heterogeneous firms</li><li>Supplementary materials in each chapter</li><li>Theoretical and empirical exercises</li><li>Two appendices describe methods for international trade research</li></ul><p></p></p><p><p>Praise for the previous editon: "No other book in advanced international trade matches this one in providing a clear, complete, up-to-date, balanced, and systematic summary of international trade theory and evidence.

Designed specifically for allied health students, early chapters lay the groundwork for learning pharmacology by introducing its history, legal and ethical principles, drug administration techniques, essential math, calculations, and medication errors. Subsequent chapters offer a structured presentation of the drugs intended to treat specific body systems and associated disorders. <br> <br>Each drug chapter starts with a concise review of anatomy and physiology, providing a foundation for understanding drug actions and uses. Pharmacologic principles are then presented in a consistent and easy-to-follow format, using clearly identifiable question-headings that help students focus on need-to-know drug information. Pediatric and geriatric pharmacotherapies are covered in detail, as are substance abuse, antibiotics, and other drug categories. Updated with the latest drug information and featuring seven new chapters, the Third Edition&#x2019;s focused, teach-and-test approach blends concise content with an engaging learning process to help students better retain essential information. <br> <br> <b>For even more practice and review opportunities pair <i>Focus on Pharmacology</i> with the completely revised and expanded Student Workbook. </b>The Workbook (ISBN-10: 0134525299 / ISBN-13: 9780134525297) contains many different types of review questions, including multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, true/false, and critical-thinking.</p><p><p> <b>Jahangir Moini, MD, MPH, </b>was Assistant Professor at Tehran University School of Medicine for 9 years, teaching medical and allied health students.

In doing so, they highlight what has made Dante a vital point of reference for modern writers and readers, both inside and outside Italy. They emphasize the distinctive and dynamic interplay in Dante's writing between argument, ideas, and analysis on the one hand, and poetic imagination on the other. <br><br>Dante was highly concerned with the political and intellectual issues of his time, demonstrated most powerfully in his notorious work, <em>The Divine Comedy</em>. Tracing the tension between the medieval and modern aspects, Hainsworth and Robey provide a clear insight into the meaning of this masterpiece of world literature. They highlight key figures and episodes in the poem, bringing out the originality and power of Dante's writing to help readers understand the problems that Dante wanted his audience to confront but often left up to the reader to resolve.<br> <br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong><br>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

D�rer&#39;s image came to characterize the outlook of most early modern Europeans, who saw repeated episodes of war, epidemics and famine as indicating the imminent end of the world. Lavishly illustrated with fascinating contemporary images, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse brings together religious, social, military and medical history, giving readers a unique insight into the early modern world. Andrew Cunningham is a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science in the University of Cambridge. His most recent book is The Anatomical Renaissance (1997). Ole Peter Grell is a Lecturer in Early Modern History at the Open University, Milton Keynes. Among his recent books are Calvinist Exiles in Tudor and Stuart England (Scolar Press, 1997) and Paracelsus: The Man and His Reputation (Brill Academic Publishers, 1998). Together the authors have published Health Care and Poor Relief in Protestant Europe 1500-1700 (Routledge, 1997) and Health Care and Poor Relief in Counter-Reformation Europe (Routledge, 1999). Since 1998 they have edited the series History of Medicine in Context published by Ashgate.</p><p>Cunningham and Grell offer a new and exciting interpretation of European history in the period 1490 to 1648 using the prism of D�rer&#39;s woodcut, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. This image came to characterise the outlook of most early modern Europeans, who saw repeated episodes of war, epidemics and famine as indicating the imminent end of the world. The book is lavishly illustrated with fascinating contemporary images; it brings together religious, social, military and medical history, giving students a unique insight into the early modern world.Albrecht D?rer's famous woodcut of the four horsemen as described in the Book of Revelation has been studied at great length and from many angles. However, the authors of this new study make a significant contribution to the discussion by demonstrating that contemporary folk consciously used this particular image to better understand the troubles that beset them and to frame these crises in an intelligible and meaningful context. As Cunningham and Grell, of Cambridge University and the Open University, respectively, maintain, D?rer's Four Horsemen informed the sense of apocalyptic dread that permeated European society from about 1490 until 1648, when the end of the 30 Years War brought about a more stabilized society that no longer used the Apocalypse as its defining paradigm. D?rer, of course, was not the first artist to create an image of the Apocalypse. However, the authors argue compellingly that what made D?rer's image resonate so strongly with his contemporaries (and with generations of artists afterward) was that it showed all of the horsemen arriving together, thus unifying the three horsemen representing the crises of war, famine, disease and death with the rider of the white horse, who represented Judgment Day, an event feared daily by the men and women of the Middle Ages. Unlike authors who approach medieval European history from various, discrete lenses (e.g., military history, social history, Reformation history), Cunningham and Grell aver that they offer a more comprehensive understanding of the medieval worldview. Their effort, following the lead of Norman Cohen's defining Pursuit of the Millennium, provides an enlightening and valuable contribution to the study of the role of eschatology in the early modern world that will hold much interest for students of that period. 71 illus.

Despite increased fieldwork opportunities for foreigners in the former Soviet Union in recent years, much of Russia and Siberia remains terra incognita to Western scholars, except for specialists who know the Russian literature. Ziker&#39;s account of the Dolgan and Nganasan peoples of the Ust Avam community is a fascinating analysis of how people adapt their hunting, fishing, and herding not only to the demanding Arctice environment but also to enormous economic and political adversities created in the wake of the Soviet Union&#39;s collapse. In this sense, the book fills a gap in the ethnographic literature on Siberia for Western students and, at the same time, serves as a microcosm of the devastating changes affecting rural communities and indigenous peoples generally in a disintegrating former superpower; that is, increasing isolation and a shift to nonmarket survival economies.</p><p>Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Balikci, The Netsilik Eskimo (ISBN 978881334357); Brody, Maps and Dreams: Indians and the British Columbia Frontier (ISBN 9780881339659); Jarvenpa, Northern Passage: Ethnography and Apprenticeship among the Subarctic Dene (ISBN 97800881339901); and Kawagley, A Yupiaq Worldview: A Pathway to Ecology and Spirit, Second Edition (ISBN 9781577663843).</p><h2>Livy: History of Rome, Volume III, Books 5-7 (Loeb Classical Library No. 172)</h2><p><p>Livy (Titus Livius), the great Roman historian, was born at or near Patavium (Padua) in 64 or 59 BCE; he may have lived mostly in Rome but died at Patavium, in 12 or 17 CE.</p><p>Livy's only extant work is part of his history of Rome from the foundation of the city to 9 BCE.

Was your thought a stream of sensations? Or was it a voice in your head? Did you ask yourself, "I wonder what that's about?" Did you answer? And what does it mean if you did?<br><br>When someone says they hear voices in their head, they are often thought to be mentally ill. But, as Charles Fernyhough argues in <i>The Voices Within</i>, such voices are better understood as one of the chief hallmarks of human thought. Our inner voices can be self-assured, funny, profound, hesitant, or mean; they can appear in different accents and even in sign language. We all hear them-and we needn't fear them. Indeed, we cannot live without them: we need them, whether to make decisions or to bring a book's characters to life as we read. Studying them can enrich our understanding of ourselves, and our understanding of the world around us; it can help us understand the experiences of visionary saints, who might otherwise be dismissed as schizophrenics; to alleviate the suffering of those who do have mental health problems; and to understand why the person next to us on the subway just burst out laughing for no apparent reason.<br><br>Whether the voices in our heads are meandering lazily or clashing chaotically, they deserve to be heard.

What ethical guidelines are needed to ensure that spiritual care in ministry is appropriate? </p> <p>� Many people in our world do not consider themselves &#x201c;religious,&#x201d; but use the term &#x201c;spiritual.&#x201d; The burgeoning interest in &#x201c;spirituality&#x201d; is an invitation to people with little training to set themselves up as &#x201c;spiritual directors.&#x201d; Guidelines are needed not simply for the ethical practice of parish ministry, but for specific practices of spiritual direction.</p> <p>&nbsp;� Allegations of &#x201c;spiritual abuse&#x201d; have been made both in practice and in the literature; the term is being used with some frequency.

I think of him looking out at me from deep within his cold armor. His eyes beseech me. Rescue me, they say. Melt my prison, breathe on my fate, and release me with the heat of your forgiveness.<br> <br>Auntie Aminah used to say that there were people who died as they lived, and others who did &#x201c;quite the opposite.&#x201d; She was referring to the lazy woman who died dancing, or the man with the energy of fire who lay on his deathbed like a snuffed-out ember. According to my aunt, such mismatched deaths left an imbalance for the angels to tinker with in the World to Come. Asaf&#x2019;s death was like that. He was a boy on a thundering horse, a child of the hot northern dunes&#x2014;yet he died a cold, still death, trapped like a bug in frozen amber. But Hani died as she lived, inscribed with henna. Her killer took a knife and used it to trace her intricate henna tattoos, carving through the skin on the soles of her feet, her shins, her palms, the backs of her hands, her forearms; slicing her into an elaborate, bloody decoration. She was tied up and left that way and must have bled to death. If such barbarity had happened in Qaraah, or in Sana&#x2019;a or in Aden, we would have assumed that it was the family of one of the brides. When a marriage went wrong, or a first baby was born dead, the henna dyer was often blamed, as if the henna dyer&#x2019;s art were more than art, as if it could really ward off or conjure evil. When I learned of Asaf&#x2019;s and Hani&#x2019;s deaths, I held my hands up to my face. I hadn&#x2019;t worn henna for many years, but the old markings seemed to appear on my skin&#x2014;my own ghostly lacery. The henna elements on my palms became letters, the letters spelled their names. And there it was. Their stories inscribed on my skin, their smiles and sorrows my own tattoos.<br> <br>Now I spend my days surrounded by my children and grandchildren. In their laughter, I discern codes and secrets. Sometimes I decipher what I hear. Sometimes, I am stumped. Life itself has become a puzzle to be translated, a curse or a blessing written in the language of henna.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>It was my husband who suggested that I write this story. He said, &#x201c;This story will submit to you, and to you alone.&#x201d; His words made me wonder: Do stories submit to authors? Or do authors submit to the tales that tangle up their guts? I confessed to him that if I were to write about Hani and Asaf, I would have to write a love story, &#x201c;For I never stopped loving them,&#x201d; I said shamefacedly to the man who had rescued me from their manifold betrayals.<br> <br>He wasn&#x2019;t cowed. &#x201c;Love them,&#x201d; my husband urged, &#x201c;write them, and write yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>I tried to begin, but my story came out in a voice I didn&#x2019;t recognize. I tried again, and I failed again because my chapters were all told from a faulty perspective. Then I failed a third time. I finally realized that I was going about it all wrong. I didn&#x2019;t need characters but ingredients. I didn&#x2019;t need settings or scenes, I needed age-old herbal recipes passed down from mother to daughter, aunt to niece. I didn&#x2019;t need plot or point of view, but symbols so old they were once swirling in the dust of creation. I didn&#x2019;t need pen or paper, I needed stylus and skin. I am a woman of henna so I needed to rely upon the traditions and tools of my craft.<br> <br>I began yet again, but writing in henna presented its own challenges. You see, the master henna dyers in my family always started elaborate applications in different places. Aunt Rahel always began with the palm of her subject&#x2019;s right hand because of the psalm: &#x201c;If I forget thee O Jerusalem, then let my right hand forget its cunning.&#x201d; She liked to say that henna was prayer in color, and prayer was henna in words. My cousin Nogema favored the tips of the fingers. My cousin Edna always started by inscribing elaborate elements on the tops of her subjects&#x2019; feet, because her designs depended most of all on symmetry and balance. And my cousin Hani, whose story I had set out to tell? She never began in the same place. She was the first to admit that her haphazard approach wasn&#x2019;t scientific and sometimes resulted in aesthetic disasters. But more often than not, Hani&#x2019;s designs were the most beautiful of all. When I was well practiced in the henna craft, I preferred to start with the underside of the forearm. My subject would stand before me with her arm raised, her hand on my shoulder. That way I could decorate the bottom of her bicep without smearing the top of the arm.<br> <br>So you see, we all had our own tricks; the only thing you could say about all of our techniques is that in the end, the first line blended into the last like blood running through veins.<br> <br>As for my story? Where should I begin? Should I ask my reader to extend an open palm so that I can inscribe my words in the warm gully of a branching life line, and our fates may mingle? Or should I ask her to recline on jasmine-scented pillows and let me begin with the tender soles of the feet, so that my story accompanies her wherever she goes, pressed into the earth, like footprints for posterity? Or should I demand my reader reveal her bosom, so that I may write these words upon her heart?<br> <br>I have done a great deal of thinking about this matter. About where to begin a story that ends with blood and sacrifice. At last I have come to believe that my story begins on the day the Confiscator came to my father&#x2019;s shop for the first time. This man, the monster of my childhood, the ghost who haunts my dreams, casts the same shadow as all the other predators who have hounded my people since the dawn of time. Different men, they are all descendants of the same ancient darkness.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>I was just five years old when the Confiscator came. We lived in Qaraah, a day&#x2019;s ride from the ancient city of Sana&#x2019;a in the Kingdom of North Yemen. The year was 1923. Yes, this is where my story must begin. Many years have passed since I last sharpened my stylus, but I feel the old elements ready at my fingertips. Palm, soul, heart. If my hand is steady, the last line will blend into the first, and ends will embrace beginnings.<br> <br>What was it that Aunt Rahel used to say to the girls and women whose limbs she would adorn with intricate and beautiful henna designs that marked the skin and pierced the heart? Whether they were there for a henna of solace or a henna of celebration, she treated them all with the utmost tenderness. She would beg them to relax, whisper soothing secrets in their ears, and comfort them with a blessing, a calming word. And then she would begin to draw&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><h2>Imitation of Christ</h2><p><p>Adapted by Sister Halcon J.

This book is the standard by which others are judged. Easy-to-understand and thorough in its approach, this method addresses both melody playing and chord strumming. Through numerous studies, folk songs and several duets, students are systematically introduced to the various notes and positions on the tenor banjo fretboard. Photos of the fretboard fingertips aid in learning the proper hand positions. Once in two volumes, this method is now presented it its entirety in this single comprehensive edition. In notation only.</p><p>Mel Bay was born on February 25, 1913 in the little Ozark Mountain town of Bunker, Missouri. He bought a Sears Roebuck guitar at the age of 13 and several months later played his first &#34;gig.&#34; (He recalled playing until his fingers were raw!) Mel took up the tenor banjo shortly thereafter and continued to play both instruments. During his teenage years Mel played with a wild assortement of bands and characters in rural Missouri. Perhaps no &#34;gig&#34; was as strange as the job he landed with, in Mel&#39;s words, &#34;a snake oil salesman.&#34; This flamboyant peddler would pull his ostentatious Pierce Arrow automobile, complete with steer horns mounted on the grill, into the center of a small, rural town. Mel would sit on the car and play up a storm on the tenor banjo. After a crowd gathered, the peddler took over and began extolling the merits of his &#34;wonder elixer.&#34; In 1933 Mel Bay moved to St. Louis and began his professional career. He played with numerous local and traveling bands. In addition, he landed staff guitar jobs on several radio stations. Mel fronted his own trio (piano, bass, guitar) and played steadily for 25 years! He was equally adept on most fretted instruments and played mandolin, uke, Hawaiian guitar, tenor and plectrum banjo professionally. While Mel was actively pursuing his playing career, he continued to teach as many as 100 students a week. He decided to begin writing instructional materials due to the difficulty encountered by guitarists at playing good sounding chord forms in rhythm sections and due to the poor note reading ability prevalent among guitarists. After the war Mel was asked to write instructional materials on guitar for GI&#39;s wanting to learn music under the GI Bill. In 1947 Mel formed his own publishing company and wrote his landmark initial book titled The Orchestral Chord System for Guitar. (This book is still in print under the title Rhythm Guitar Chord System and continues to be one the finest rhythm guitar chord texts available!) His Modern Guitar Method was penned shortly thereafter. For years Mel traveled from town to town talking to guitar teachers and players and showing them his publications. At one time Mel claims to have known virtually every guitar teacher in America on a first name basis! The guitar and Mel Bay books caught on in a big way in the 1950&#39;s. Things have continued to grow ever since. Mel used to sell D&#39;Angelico guitars. At any given time he would have 5 or 6 &#34;lying around the house.&#34; Mel played professionally on his New Yorker model but his favorite was the initial Mel Bay Model crafted as a gift for him by John D&#39;Angelico. This famous guitar had all of the main features of the New Yorker but was a &#34;cut away&#34; model and had a slightly thinner neck. This instrument has been pictured on the Mel Bay Modern Guitar Method for decades. Someone once calculated that sales of guitar books written by Mel Bay have exceeded 25 million copies. When asked, Mel frequently said that he quit counting long ago. Sales of his Modern Guitar Method have alone surpassed the 7 million mark. It is safe to say that Mel Bay is one of the pivotal figures in the world of guitar music and instruction in this century.</p><h2>Woman in the Mists: The Story of Dian Fossey and the Mountain Gorillas of Africa</h2><p>Deep in the volcano country of central Africa live some of the rarest, most intriguing animals on earth -- the mountain gorillas.

In &#34;Seven Winters&#34;, Elizabeth Bowen recalls, with endearing candour, her family and Dublin childhood.</p><p>Elizabeth Bowen was born in Dublin in 1899, the only child of an Irish lawyer and landowner. She was educated at Downe House School in Kent. Her book Bowen&#39;s Court (1942) is the history of her family and their house in County Cork, and Seven Winters (1943) contains reminiscences of her Dublin childhood. In 1923 she married Alan Cameron, who held an appointment with the BBC and who died in 1952. She travelled a good deal, dividing most of her time between London and Bowen&#39;s Court, which she inherited. Elizabeth Bowen is considered by many to be one of the most distinguished novelists of the twentieth century. Her first book, a collection of short stories, Encounters, appeared in 1923, followed by another, Ann Lee&#39;s, in 1926. The Hotel (1927) was her first novel, and was followed by The Last September (1929), Joining Charles (1929), another book of short stories, Friends and Relations (1931), To the North (1932), The Cat Jumps (short stories, 1934), The House in Paris (1935), The Death of the Heart (1938), Look at All Those Roses (short stories, 1941), The Demon Lover (short stories, 1945), The Heat of the Day (1949), Collected Impressions (essays, 1950), The Shelborne (1951), A World of Love (1955), A Time in Rome (1960), Afterthought (essays, 1962), The Little Girls (1964), A Day in the Dark (1965) and her last book Eva Trout (1969). She was awarded the CBE in 1948, and received honorary degrees from Trinity College, Dublin in 1949, and from Oxford University in 1956. In the same year she was appointed Lacy Martin Donnelly Fellow at Bryn Mawr College in the United States. The Royal Society of Literature made her a Companion of Literature in 1965.

In its time, it quickly became a box office success and probably inspired Shakespeare to write <i>Hamlet</i>, as it contains a ghost, murders that demand revenge and a hero that hesitates and contemplates suicide. As a revenge tragedy, it set up the salient features of a dramatic genre that would last decades. Its hero, the aged Marshall of Spain Hieronimo, whose son is murdered at night, soon transcended the play and became the standard stage representation of grief, rhetorical passion and madness. Hieronimo's main antagonist is one of the first Machiavellian characters of English drama. </p><p>This edition explores the play in relation to its historical context and contemporary Iberian dynastic policy. It also relates the play, as a literary artefact, to other artistic manifestations of the European Renaissance and offers a fresh assessment of the play's stage history. For the first time in the play's textual history, this edition presents an integrated text inviting a reading of the play as it was published both in 1592 and in 1602.</p></p><p>A major new edition of this classic tragedy with full annotation and a lengthy introduction examining the play in its historical, theatrical and literary contexts.<p>Clara Calvo, University of Murcia, Spain<br>Jesus Tronch, University of Valencia, Spain</p></p><h2>B-17 Nose Art Name Directory</h2><p>This directory is the product of years of statistical research by author Wallace Forman.

Drucker discusses how the new paradigms of management have changed and will continue to change our basic assumptions about the practices and principles of management. Forward-looking and forward-thinking, <em>Management Challenges for the 21st Century</em> combines the broad knowledge, wide practical experience, profound insight, sharp analysis, and enlightened common sense that are the essence of Drucker's writings and "landmarks of the managerial profession." --<em>Harvard Business Review</em></p></p><p>No single person has influenced the course of business in the 20th century as much as Peter Drucker. He practically invented management as a discipline in the 1950s, elevating it from an ignored, even despised, profession into a necessary institution that "reflects the basic spirit of the modern age." Now, in <i>Management Challenges for the 21st Century</i>, Drucker looks at the profound social and economic changes occurring today and considers how management--not government or free markets--should orient itself to address these new realities.<p> Drucker sees the period we're living in as one of "PROFOUND TRANSITION--and the changes are more radical perhaps than even those that ushered in the 'Second Industrial Revolution' of the middle of the 19th century, or the structural changes triggered by the Great Depression and the Second World War." In the midst of all this change, he contends, there are five social and political certainties that will shape business strategy in the not-too-distant future: the collapsing birthrate in the developed world; shifts in distribution of disposable income; a redefinition of corporate performance; global competitiveness; and the growing incongruence between economic and political reality. Drucker then looks at requirements for leadership ("One cannot manage change. One can only be ahead of it"), the characteristics of the "new information revolution" (one should focus on the meaning of information, not the technology that collects it), productivity of the knowledge worker (unlike manual workers, knowledge workers must be seen as capital assets, not costs), and finally the responsibilities that knowledge workers must assume in managing themselves and their careers.</p><p> Drucker's writing career spans eight decades and the years have only served to sharpen his insight and perspective in a way that makes most other management texts seem derivative. While <i>Management Challenges for the 21st Century</i> is no quick airplane read, it is a wise and thought-provoking book that will both challenge and inspire the diligent reader. This book is for people who care about their businesses and careers in the information age--CEOs, managers, and knowledge workers. Highly recommended. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i></p><p>Peter F. Drucker is considered the most influential management thinker ever. The author of more than twenty-five books, his ideas have had an enormous impact on shaping the modern corporation. Drucker passed away in 2005. </p></p><h2>Meant to Be Mine</h2><p><b>2015 INSPY Award Winner<br>2015 Inspirational Reader's Choice Award Winner (Now Known as Faith, Hope, &amp; Love Reader's Choice Award)<br></b><br><br>Ty Porter has always been irresistible to Celia Park.

It keeps us from behaving intelligently, since the mind's first reaction to fear is to ignore danger, hoping it will go away. When fear takes over, it drives us to extremes of manic happiness or fits of rage; it pushes us to destroy relationships instead of letting relationships help us defeat it. When fear wins the battle, viciousness sets in, and we have miserable lives in a miserable world. Most important, fear keeps us from the one thing that could stop its taking over: becoming present.<p>Robert Sardello, an exceptionally&nbsp;powerful&nbsp;writer who Larry Dossey deems "one of the&nbsp;few modern&nbsp;thinkers who genuinely senses how to deal with the barrenness of modern life,"&nbsp;argues that the soul's greatest enemy is fear. It is only when we can look honestly at every fear<b>&#x2014;</b>from insecurity at work to existential angst<b>&#x2014;</b>that we may fulfill its potential for kindness, love, and compassion.</p><p>This book is at once an inspiring manual for dealing with fear and a&nbsp;call to arms to change our situation and thereby change the world. It is a rich combination of theory, anecdote, exercises for strengthening the soul, and the wisdom of a great student of the soul.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Robert Sardello is considered a leading philosopher on the soul, having inspired both Thomas Moore's and James Hillman's writings. Once again he departs from common spiritual assumptions in this intelligent and smoothly written handbook, <i>Freeing the Soul from Fear</i>. One of the more popular attitudes toward the soul is that it's a permanent element of the human being, Sardello explains. As a result, current spiritual guidance often discusses how to reconnect with our impermeable souls through meditation, honoring suffering, and returning to a sense of enchantment.<p> As important as this reconnection is, Sardello believes that it does not go far enough. Rather, we should recognize the soul as a vulnerable entity and commit to strengthening its core. And what weakens a soul the most? Fear. Fundamentally, it contracts the soul's ability to love. And above all else, love comes from the soul--"an experience through which another person, or a spiritual being, or God lives within us," Sardello explains. Chapter by chapter, Sardello examines how perennial fears (such as money, relationships, and death) as well as contemporary fears (Y2K, terrorism, and time collapse) affect the soul. He then offers concrete suggestions for overcoming soul-debilitating fears through love and imagination. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><b>Robert Sardello</b> is a pioneer figure in the study of the soul.

In March 1981, luck and inspired police work at last produced an arrest, and Spokane shuddered. The suspect was clean cut and conservative...and Gordon Coe&#x2019;s son.<br> <br>For eighteen months, Jack Olsen researched the cases of Fred and Ruth Coe to try to learn not only what happened within that family, but how and why. He interviewed more than 150 people and built up a portrait not only of that extraordinary family, but of the mind of a psychopath. And searching the memories of the women in Fred Coe&#x2019;s life, he unearthed a most horrifying question: What is it like to love and live with a man for years&#x2014;and then discover he is a psychopathic criminal?<br> <br>In this &#x201c;gruesomely spellbinding&#x201d; (<i>Glamour</i>) examination of the mind of a psychopath and of the women&#x2014;and men&#x2014;who were his victims, Olsen delivers &#x201c;a harrowing portrait...It has become fashionable with books about vicious crimes to compare them to Truman Capote&#x2019;s <i>In Cold Blood</i>. Finally there is a book that deserves the comparison&#x201d; (<i>Richmond Times-Dispatch</i>).</p><p>On one level, this 1984 Edgar Award Nominee is the story of a sociopathic rapist, a clean-cut realtor named Fred Coe who raped dozens of women in sunny Spokane, Washington. Olsen paints the portrait of a man whose exterior grandiosity and air of <i>savoir faire</i> barely conceal his deep insecurity about his career failures--a temperamental prima donna who emulates the pathetic hero of "American Gigolo." But on another, even more compelling level, this is the story of the women in Fred's life: His histrionic, clinging mother is a fair-skinned beauty in jet-black wigs, outrageous attire, and excessive jewelry, who eventually plots to kill the judge and prosecutor who put her dear "Son" away. A wife, and later on a girlfriend, both devoted to Fred, are devastated by his exposure as a brutal rapist. And several of Fred's many victims are also compassionately portrayed in all their individuality.Born June 7, 1925, Jack Olsen was the award-winning author of thirty-three books published in fifteen countries and eleven languages, including <i>Son: A Psychopath and His Victims</i>. A former <i>Time</i> bureau chief, Olsen wrote for <i>Vanity Fair, People, Sports Illustrated, Fortune, </i>and <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, among others.</p><h2>Early Greek Philosophy, Volume VIII: Sophists, Part 1 (Loeb Classical Library)</h2><p><p>The fragments and testimonia of the early Greek philosophers (often labeled the Presocratics) have always been not only a fundamental source for understanding archaic Greek culture and ancient philosophy but also a perennially fresh resource that has stimulated Western thought until the present day. This new systematic conception and presentation of the evidence differs in three ways from Hermann Diels&#x2019;s groundbreaking work, as well as from later editions: it renders explicit the material&#x2019;s thematic organization; it includes a selection from such related bodies of evidence as archaic poetry, classical drama, and the Hippocratic corpus; and it presents an overview of the reception of these thinkers until the end of antiquity.</p><p> Volume I contains introductory and reference materials essential for using all other parts of the edition. Volumes II&#x2013;III include chapters on ancient doxography, background, and the Ionians from Pherecydes to Heraclitus. Volumes IV&#x2013;V present western Greek thinkers from the Pythagoreans to Hippo. Volumes VI&#x2013;VII comprise later philosophical systems and their aftermath in the fifth and early fourth centuries. Volumes VIII&#x2013;IX present fifth-century reflections on language, rhetoric, ethics, and politics (the so-called sophists and Socrates) and conclude with an appendix on philosophy and philosophers in Greek drama.</p></p><p><p>Andr� Laks is Professor Emeritus of Ancient Philosophy at the University of Paris&#x2013;Sorbonne, and Professor of Ancient Philosophy at the Universidad Panamericana, Mexico City.</p><p>Glenn W.

And spending a few months doing so gives the reader almost all that she needs (perhaps along with Loeb #258, <i>Greek Elegiac Poetry</i>) to reconstruct for herself the origins of the discipline of philosophy.

But the crusaders never made it to the Holy Land. Steered forward by the shrewd Venetian doge, they descended instead on Constantinople, wreaking terrible devastation. The crusaders spared no one: They raped and massacred thousands, plundered churches, and torched the lavish city. By 1204, one of the great civilizations of history had been shattered. Here, on the eight hundredth anniversary of the sack, is the extraordinary story of this epic catastrophe, told for the first time outside of academia by Jonathan Phillips, a leading expert on the crusades. Knights and commoners, monastic chroniclers, courtly troubadours, survivors of the carnage, and even Pope Innocent III left vivid accounts detailing the events of those two fateful years. Using their remarkable letters, chronicles, and speeches, Phillips traces the way in which any region steeped in religious fanaticism, in this case Christian Europe, might succumb to holy war.</p><p>A remarkable assessment of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, which set out to free Jerusalem from the grip of Islam, and ended in the expedition?s savage attack on the Christian city of Constantinople.Jonathan Phillips, a senior lecturer in medieval history at Royal Holloway, University of London, is the author of a number of books on the crusades, including <b>Defenders of the Holy Land</b> and <b>The Crusades: 1095&#x2013;1197</b>.

The incorporation of this island into the Qing empire in the seventeenth century and its evolution into a province by the late nineteenth century involved not only a reconsideration of imperial geography but also a reconceptualization of the Chinese domain. The annexation of Taiwan was only one incident in the much larger phenomenon of Qing expansionism into frontier areas that resulted in a doubling of the area controlled from Beijing and the creation of a multi-ethnic polity. The author argues that travelers' accounts and pictures of frontiers such as Taiwan led to a change in the imagined geography of the empire. In representing distant lands and ethnically diverse peoples of the frontiers to audiences in China proper, these works transformed places once considered non-Chinese into familiar parts of the empire and thereby helped to naturalize Qing expansionism.</p><p>By viewing Taiwan-China relations as a product of the history of Qing expansionism, the author contributes to our understanding of current political events in the region.</p></p><p>Emma J. Teng is Professor of Chinese Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&#x201c;Refreshingly, Teng divorces the relationship of the island and the mainland from the now stale arguments over reunification, or whether or not Taiwan is part of China, and grounds it in the tantalizing history of Chinese imperialism. She draws on Qing dynasty (1644&#x2013;1911) travel writing and paintings to argue that China effectively colonized the island... Teng makes adroit use of a growing body of literature stigmatizing China as a colonial conqueror&#x2015;rather than a victim of European colonialism&#x2015;and incorporates the importance of Taiwan into the debate on Chinese expansionism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Macabe Keliher</b><b>, </b><b><i>Far Eastern Economic Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Teng paints an intriguing picture of the debates that emerged concerning the colonization of Taiwan and official Qing policy towards the island&#x2019;s indigenous peoples... Teng is making a significant contribution to the study of imperialism overall, and is suggesting that it is time to move beyond the confines by which colonialism is seen as the exclusive practice of Western men.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jeremy E. Taylor</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Thoroughly examining Qing dynastic travel accounts and maps of Taiwan, Teng has written a splendid analysis of changing Chinese perceptions of Taiwan and its indigenous peoples from the late 17th century on, culminating in Taiwan&#x2019;s becoming a province of China in 1887... This book should be read by anyone interested in early Taiwanese history or in better understanding the current views about Taiwan held by Chinese in both the Republic of China and the People&#x2019;s Republic of China. Those interested in discourses about the nature of imperialism or in how depictions of indigenous native peoples are manipulated to suit colonizers&#x2019; needs will also find this book worthwhile.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>V.

It is a story of imagination, deception, and art that spotlights today&#x2019;s most brilliant young magicians&#x2014;a mysterious club known as the52, who are revolutionizing an ancient artform under the mantra Magic Is Dead.</p><p>Ian brings us with him as he not only gets to know this fascinating world, but also becomes an integral part of it. We meet the52&#x2019;s founding members&#x2014;Laura London, Daniel Madison, and Chris Ramsay&#x2014;and explore their personal demons, professional aspirations, and what drew them to their craft. We join them at private gatherings of the most extraordinary magicians working today, follow them to magic conventions in Las Vegas and England, and discover some of the best tricks of the trade. We also encounter David Blaine; hang out with Penn Jillette; meet Dynamo, the U.K.&#x2019;s most famous magician; and go behind the scenes of a Netflix magic show. <em>Magic Is Dead</em> is also a chronicle of magic&#x2019;s rich history and how it has changed in the internet age, as the young guns embrace social media and move away from the old-school take on the craft.</p><p>As he tells the story of the52, and his role as its most unlikely member, Ian reveals his own connection with trickery and deceit and how he first learned the elements that make magic work from his poker-playing mother.

Hustling to make a name for himself as a journalist, feverishly pitching ideas while squatting in a New Hampshire office building, he needed a story that was going to take his career to a new level. He also needed a confidence boost. When he landed on the Instagram page of Chris Ramsay, he believed he had found what he was looking for. But what began as a profile of a magician using the internet to cultivate his fan base, quickly became a ride through underground magic, one that ripped open Frisch's life in the process. </p><p>"Magic Is Dead" is the mantra of a secret society of magicians, of which Ramsay is a member. They call themselves the52. A family of misfits bonded by troubled pasts and a passion for illusion, mystery, and casting aside the tired clich�s of magic that are so prevalent, the52 has two goals--to keep their qualifications for membership in the shadows, and to transform the art form that the members revere. With Ramsay as his guide, Ian attends private gatherings; meets the masters in the field like Penn Jillette, Dynamo, and David Blaine; and is invited into the inner sanctum of a world he never knew existed. Forming close bonds with the founders, Laura London and Daniel Madison, he is welcomed into the group, if puzzled as to why. And when he is invited to become the most unlikely member, his initial goal of writing a great story is replaced by something far more personal. </p><p>Rich with the history of magic from the very dawn of the art form, full of details about the business of making magic today, and populated with a cast of characters--both well known and unknown--that comes alive on the page, Magic Is Dead is a page-turning and often surprising work of immersive journalism. But coupled with this is a deeply personal story of a young man searching for himself.</p><p>From the dark alleys of Blackpool, England, to the glitz of Las Vegas to the back lots of Hollywood where magic is being crafted, here is a portrait of the past, present, and future of magic. Written with psychological acuity and a keen eye for detail, <em>Magic Is Dead</em> is an engrossing tale that will keep you guessing until the very end.</p><p>Ian Frisch has written for <em>The New Yorker</em>, The New York <em>Times</em>, <em>The Washington Post </em><em>Magazine</em>, <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>, <em>Playboy</em>, <em>Wired</em>, and <em>Vice</em>.

Dunham. The 24-year-old officer had been navigating an RB-29 reconnaissance plane northeast of Japan&#x2019;s Hokkaido island when two Soviet fighters opened fire. The lumbering, propeller-driven American aircraft caught fire and crashed into the sea; Dunham and seven other airmen perished. The Russians buried Dunham a few days later on Yuri without bothering to hold a ceremony or notify his next of kin.</p><p>The incident was just one of many Cold War run-ins&#x2014;some of them fatal&#x2014;between U.S. intelligence collectors and communist defenders. Starting in 1945, American planes, surface ships, and submarines skirted the borders of the USSR, China, North Korea, and various Eastern European nations, probing and analyzing their defenses.</p><p>The Sea of Japan was a hot spot in this little-known drama. U.S. planes monitored hundreds of miles of coastline running from Wonsan, a major North Korean port protected by scores of MiG fighters, to Vladivostok, headquarters of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, and farther north to Petropavlovsk, another important Russian naval station near the tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Flying aboard lightly armed aircraft stuffed with eavesdropping equipment, specialists known as &#x201c;ravens&#x201d; tuned in on communist radio, Morse code, and radar emissions. Their planes usually stayed in international airspace, but occasionally they darted over the border, as if on a bombing run, to &#x201c;spoof&#x201d; communist air defenses. When alarmed ground commanders switched on antiaircraft radars, the ravens carefully noted their location and frequencies, crucial targeting data in the event of war. The American aircraft also recorded details of how Soviet jets were scrambled, and sniffed the atmosphere for telltale chemical traces of nuclear tests.</p><p>Soviet and North Korean fighters often were content simply to fly alongside, watching the watchers. But sometimes they reacted with lethal fury. Between 1950 and 1956, for instance, seven U.S. reconnaissance aircraft were shot down over the Sea of Japan, the Kurils, or near Siberia; at least 46 airmen were killed or listed as missing. (Another plane bearing 16 Americans disappeared in a typhoon.) Washington responded with sharply worded protests and more spy flights.</p><p>U.S. submarines, meanwhile, kept an eye on Soviet naval operations. Often prowling perilously close to shore, they taped distinctive propeller noises made by Russian subs, compiling an audio &#x201c;library&#x201d; that could identify any Soviet undersea boat anywhere in the world. American crews planted listening devices on the ocean floor to detect communist naval movements. They observed sea trials of the Russians&#x2019; new missile subs and measured the telemetry of ballistic rockets as they arced from launch sites in the USSR to splash down in the Pacific.</p><p>Aircraft and submarines were an expensive way to spy, however. They had the additional disadvantage of being able to stay on target for only relatively short periods. The Navy sometimes used destroyers for surveillance, but such missions took fighting ships away from more pressing duties.</p><p>Faced with the same problems, the Soviets solved them by loading eavesdropping gear aboard fishing trawlers, inexpensive, harmless-looking vessels that could loiter in the same area for days or weeks on end. By 1965, almost three dozen trawlers were watching American nuclear subs coming and going from bases in South Carolina, Scotland, and Guam; studying the tactics of U.S. battle groups maneuvering on the high seas; and warning the North Vietnamese whenever Navy fighter-bombers lifted off from aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin.</p><p>The trawlers sometimes even tried to interfere with the carriers, cutting across their bows as they turned into the wind to launch planes. One Soviet boat, the <i>Gidrofon</i>, was involved in six &#x201c;provocative incidents&#x201d; in the South China Sea during a single month, December 1965. Another trawler nearly collided with an American destroyer off Long Island, New York, as the Russian captain rushed to recover a test missile fired from the atomic sub USS <i>George Washington</i>.</p><p>The United States soon began outfitting its own small, cheap spy ships under Operation Clickbeetle, a top secret Navy program to pack refurbished freighters with advanced electronics. Clickbeetle was the pet project of Dr. Eugene Fubini, an energetic, bushy-haired physicist who oversaw key Pentagon research initiatives in the early 1960s. Fubini believed the snooper boats could play an important role in keeping tabs on the Soviets&#x2019; rapidly expanding blue-water fleet, which was challenging the U.S. Navy&#x2019;s supremacy in both the Pacific and the Mediterranean. He wanted up to 70 such vessels, although the Navy ultimately commissioned only three.</p><p>The most tragically famous of these was the USS <i>Pueblo</i>, which was attacked and captured by North Korean patrol boats in January 1968.</p><p>The loss of the <i>Pueblo</i>&#x2014;which was jammed with sophisticated electronic surveillance gear, code machines, and top secret documents&#x2014;turned out to be one of the worst intelligence debacles in American history. The ship&#x2019;s seizure pushed the United States closer to armed conflict on the Korean peninsula than at any time since the Korean War in the early 1950s. And subsequent investigations by Congress and the Navy revealed appalling complacency and shortsightedness in the planning and execution of the <i>Pueblo</i>&#x2019;s mission.</p><p>Nations spy on one another for a variety of reasons, some quite sensible. The most common one is the fundamental imperative of self-preservation: National leaders have a keen, if not mortal interest in knowing whether a rival state is getting ready to attack them or their allies. The main purpose of the <i>Pueblo</i>&#x2019;s ill-starred voyage was to give the United States a clearer picture of North Korea&#x2019;s ability to wage war. &#x201c;Our knowledge about North Korean military capabilities is limited and may not be altogether reliable,&#x201d; Under Secretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach wrote in a secret memo to President Lyndon Johnson. &#x201c;Our limited intelligence makes it difficult to estimate the precise nature of the threat to South Korea.&#x201d; That blind spot was particularly alarming, since 50,000 American troops were then stationed in South Korea as a bulwark against the aggressive north.</p><p>But intelligence gathering can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, acquiring reliable information about an enemy&#x2019;s intentions and capabilities may have a calming effect on international relations. If Country A verifies that Country B is not, as rumored, massing troops on their common border, Country A is less likely to mobilize its own forces, thereby reducing the chances of war. Paradoxically, good spy work can also create dangerous volatility between states. Such was the case in 1962, when a U-2 aircraft photographed Soviet technicians installing long-range missiles in Cuba, leading the United States to impose a naval quarantine on the island and raising the fearsome specter of nuclear war between the two superpowers.</p><p>In some instances, the very act of spying can catalyze international tension, as the <i>Pueblo</i> episode demonstrates.</p><p>Then as now, North Korea was one of America&#x2019;s most implacable enemies. In the late 1960s, it possessed one of the largest air forces in the communist world, along with a formidable army. Its Stalinist leaders were deeply committed to conquering South Korea. And with so many U.S. soldiers deployed in the south, Washington had ample reason to pursue additional information about what North Korea was up to.</p><p>Today, more than 45 years after the events described in this book, North Korea is still a dangerous threat to peace and stability in Northeast Asia. Its economy is a shambles and its citizens are impoverished and underfed. Its armed forces remain large and potent, and its new, 28-year-old leader, Kim Jong-un, seems bent on producing nuclear weapons and the long-range missiles needed to deliver them. The United States still conducts reconnaissance forays and North Korea still strives to fend them off. In 2003, four North Korean MiG jets tried to force down an unarmed RC-135 spy plane. Despite the risk of being attacked, the American aircrew resisted communist demands to land (one MiG pilot flew to within 50 feet of the RC-135 and gave hand signals for it to descend) and flew back to their base in Japan.</p><p>Why should the <i>Pueblo</i>&#x2019;s sole mission, bungled so long ago, matter to us now? Without a doubt, unremitting surveillance by American ships, aircraft, satellites, and human agents around the globe has helped us better understand our foes&#x2019; strengths and weaknesses. For diplomats trying to preserve the peace, or military strategists trying to win a war, the importance of accurate, timely intelligence cannot be overstated. But snooping on other countries is inherently provocative. (Indeed, North Korea regarded the <i>Pueblo</i>&#x2019;s activities as an &#x201c;act of war.&#x201d;) Since intelligence collection often carries the potential to set off an international crisis or even war, we as citizens must endeavor to restrain excessive risk taking and recklessness on the part of our professional watchers.</p><p>In order to be effective, clandestine reconnaissance missions must, of course, be clandestine. Risk-to-reward ratios can&#x2019;t exactly be debated in public before such operations are set in motion. In our democracy, we depend on Congress&#x2014;especially members of the House and Senate intelligence committees&#x2014;to provide close and continuous scrutiny of the nation&#x2019;s spy agencies. (The news media occasionally reveal details of intelligence operations, although usually after the fact.) Congressional oversight isn&#x2019;t always as robust as it should be, however. Members of Congress had little, if any, advance knowledge of how much risk was involved in the <i>Pueblo</i>&#x2019;s doomed journey to the Sea of Japan. It was only later that investigators uncovered the false assumptions, negligent planning, and embarrassingly inadequate equipment that culminated in the vessel&#x2019;s capture and set the stage for a dangerous showdown between the United States and North Korea.</p><p>As we unleash spies and covert operations against a growing list of twenty-first-century adversaries, we&#x2019;d do well to remember the painful lessons of the <i>Pueblo</i>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>SPIES AHOY</p><p>The strange little ship lay at the far end of the pier, rolling gently in the morning chop. Ensign F. Carl Schumacher stared at it from the bucket seat of his Porsche, then got out and walked down the dock, brimming with anticipation.</p><p>Schumacher didn&#x2019;t know much about the diminutive boat that was to be his new home. It certainly stood out from the vast gray warships cruising majestically through San Diego Bay, many of them bound, in that autumn of 1967, for the Vietnam War. Just 176 feet long, the USS <i>Pueblo</i> was smaller than some Navy tugboats. With no deck guns and a poky top speed of 13 knots, it was unfit for serious combat at sea. Indeed, the canvas awning that shaded its afterdeck made the <i>Pueblo</i> look more like a tramp steamer than a naval vessel, with one curious difference: Its topsides bristled with tall antennae, swaying in the breeze like giant fishing rods.</p><p>Though Schumacher hadn&#x2019;t been told yet, the <i>Pueblo</i> was an electronic intelligence collector&#x2014;a spy ship&#x2014;newly outfitted to eavesdrop on military installations along communist coastlines in the Far East. Before its conversion to seagoing ferret, the <i>Pueblo</i> had been an Army cargo ship, hauling food and supplies to remote South Pacific island bases after World War II. Given its lowly pedigree, some of its crewmen jokingly compared it to the USS<i> Reluctant</i>, the down-at-the-heels Navy freighter in the movie <i>Mister Roberts</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Skip&#x201d; Schumacher was 24 years old, a bright, perceptive Missourian who relished arguing about philosophy and trading humorous barbs with relatives and friends. Slim and blond, he had a sly smile, an unexpectedly deep voice, and a young man&#x2019;s studiedly cynical facade. The son of an affluent St. Louis insurance broker, he&#x2019;d had a privileged youth, attending a local prep school and a private college, Trinity, in Connecticut. After graduating, he signed on as a Navy officer candidate, mostly to make sure he didn&#x2019;t get drafted into the Army and shot up in some Indochinese rice paddy.</p><p>His first sea assignment had been aboard a refrigeration ship that delivered food and beer to the busy aircraft carrier crews at Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin. It was safe, dull duty, and Schumacher wanted a bit more adventure. When his transfer orders to the <i>Pueblo</i> arrived, he immediately tried to find out what sort of boat it was. Nobody seemed to know, and, mysteriously, it wasn&#x2019;t listed in the Navy directory of ships. Several weeks later, Schumacher got a letter from the <i>Pueblo</i>&#x2019;s executive officer, telling him only that the vessel was to conduct &#x201c;oceanographic research&#x201d; in the Sea of Japan. That was the spy ship&#x2019;s cover story. For its public commissioning ceremony in Bremerton, Washington, the Navy had gone so far as to bring in a local college professor to extol the <i>Pueblo</i>&#x2019;s anticipated contributions to helping mankind extract more food from the sea.</p><p>Seeing it now for the first time, Schumacher wondered whether the <i>Pueblo</i> could even stay upright in a storm. He&#x2019;d never seen a Navy ship so small that its gangplank led <i>down </i>from the dock rather than up. Nonetheless, he saluted its American flag, marched over the gangway, and presented his orders to a petty officer.</p><p>Schumacher was taken on a tour of the ship and then to lunch in the wardroom. As he sat down, conversation among the other officers fell off; that usually happened when a new face appeared in officer country.</p><p>The lull didn&#x2019;t last long.</p><p>The <i>Pueblo</i>&#x2019;s captain burst into the compartment like a sudden clap of thunder over a calm sea. Tough, charismatic, and cheerfully profane, Commander Lloyd M. Bucher had just turned 40. His arms bulged with muscle and his eyes shone with intelligence and a touch of mischievousness. He had a handsome, square-jawed face, an easy grin, and a bullhorn of a voice that could stop a belowdecks fistfight cold. To Schumacher, the skipper&#x2019;s presence seemed to electrify the very air around him.</p><p>Even seated Bucher had a dynamic quality. While one big hand shoveled food into his mouth, the other switched on a tape player mounted in the bulkhead, filling the wardroom with the rollicking ballads of Johnny Cash. Schumacher was introduced and the captain&#x2019;s right hand shot out in greeting. &#x201c;Glad to have you,&#x201d; he boomed. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you come from?&#x201d; Badly intimidated by his new boss, the young ensign stammered a few words of personal history.</p><p>Bucher was an ex&#x2013;submarine officer, a superb navigator and ship handler. In the late 1950s, he&#x2019;d served aboard subs with the delicate and dan...</p></p><h2>The Reflecting Pond: Meditations for Self-Discovery (Hazelden Meditations)</h2><p><b>Just as water reflects nature, these daily readings form distinct images of challenges we face and rewards we reap through forbearance and resilience.</b><br><br><i>The Reflecting Pond</i> is a collection of short&nbsp;readings addressing topics of universal significance, from facing anger and fear to developing courage and patience through meditation and establishing faith within.<br> <br> Used as an extra dose of support on specific issues, this book will help us think through day-to-day living problems.

Atalanta in Calydon is a drama in classical Greek form, which revealed Swinburne's metrical skills and brought him celebrity. Poems and Ballads brought him notoriety and demonstrates his preoccupation with de Sade, masochism, and femmes fatales. Also reproduced here is 'Notes on Poems and Reviews', a pamphlet Swinburne published in 1866 in response to hostile reviews of Poems and Ballads.

J. Liebling awaited the Second World War in &#x201c;a little Marseillais restaurant on the Rue Monmartre,&#x201d; dining on &#x201c;Mediterranean rouget burned in brandy over twigs of fennel.&#x201d; He had returned as a correspondent for The New Yorker to the city of his youthful adventures in food and other passions soon after the German invasion of Poland, in the fall of 1939, and he had spent the months of the Phony War in a state of suspended disbelief. Drawing comfort from the &#x201c;gastronomic normality&#x201d; of Parisian life, he convinced himself that the Nazis were overrated and the French would put up a tough fight&#x2014;that this was a replay of the First World War. Even after the Wehrmacht&#x2019;s Blitzkrieg cut through Holland and Belgium &#x201c;as through butter&#x201d; and prepared to devour France, Liebling couldn&#x2019;t believe in the coming catastrophe. &#x201c;The rouget tasted too much as good rouget always had,&#x201d; he wrote; &#x201c;the black-browed proprietor was too normally solicitous; even in the full bosom and strong legs of the waitress there was the assurance that this life in Paris would never end.&#x201d;<br><br>In some ways it was still 1925, the year of The New Yorker&#x2019;s birth. Even after a decade of worldwide depression and rising Fascist power, the magazine remained dedicated to the sophisticated tastes of what its founding editor, Harold Ross, in a letter to prospective investors and subscribers, called &#x201c;metropolitan life.&#x201d; The main stage was New York, the tone ironic and detached, never passionately engaged, immune to shock. Ross prescribed that the weekly commentary be written &#x201c;in a manner not too serious&#x201d;; the magazine prided itself on never taking a political stand. Hitler made a few scattered appearances in its pages during the thirties, as tyrant or buffoon&#x2014;notably in Janet Flanner&#x2019;s three-part Profile in 1936, based on interviews with the F�hrer, whose anti-Semitism and race fanaticism received slightly less space than his vegetarianism and celibacy. In 1933, when few people outside Germany understood what Nazism portended, E. B. White, the anonymous voice of the magazine&#x2019;s Comment, wrote, &#x201c;Thus in a single day&#x2019;s developments in Germany we go back a thousand years into the dark.&#x201d; But two years later, he fell back into characteristic lightheartedness: &#x201c;We predict that there will be no war in 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940. There will be a small war in 1941 between Cambodia and Alberta over a little matter of some Irish Sweepstake tickets, and then there will be no war in 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, and 1946. Our prophecy is no mere wish-fulfillment&#x2014;it packs a heap of personal good feelings toward nations.&#x201d; It was as if the magazine knew that the world of witty table talk, society portraits, and Broadway lowlifes was doomed, but, like a character in a Thurber sketch, it couldn&#x2019;t bring itself to wake up from an entertaining dream that had begun to quiver with sinister undertones.<br><br>At the end of the summer of 1939, with war apparently imminent, White&#x2019;s Comment finally showed The New Yorker to be capable of shock. It sounded the note of a highly civilized sensibility forced to engage with something alien, ugly, and inescapable: &#x201c;Today is Sunday, August 27th. Perhaps you don&#x2019;t remember that far back, you who presumably now dwell in a world which is either at peace or at war. . . . If war comes, it will be war, and no one wants that. If peace is restored, it will be another arrangement enlarging not simply the German boundary but the Hitler dream. The world knows it can&#x2019;t win.&#x201d;<br><br>The war opened The New Yorker to the wider world. Without changing beyond recognition, it became a more serious magazine; without sounding like Time or The New Republic, it became political. It rediscovered places it already knew, perhaps a little too well (London, Paris, Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen), and it discovered places that it had never imagined (Tunisia, the Marianas Islands). The Second World War was total war, involving cities, villages, and much of the world&#x2019;s population, with battlefields in a hotel lobby or an uninhabited island. Partly for this reason, the coverage in The New Yorker benefitted from the fact that it was a literary magazine, matching writers to subjects in ways that produced some of the greatest and most original journalism of the war.<br><br>Ross deployed much of his available talent to cover the conflict. The New Yorker&#x2019;s war correspondents included the magazine&#x2019;s former managing editor, a movie critic, a sportswriter, humorists, and short-story writers, as well as some of its leading reporters. By happenstance, Mollie Panter-Downes, an English novelist living on a pig farm in Surrey, became the magazine&#x2019;s London correspondent in time for Dunkirk and the Blitz, and her understated style perfectly captures the British talent for survival through disengagement that Americans learned to admire during the war: &#x201c;Incidentally, the announcements of the first air-raid deaths are beginning to appear in the obituary columns of the morning papers. No mention is made of the cause of death, but the conventional phrase &#x2018;very suddenly&#x2019; is always used. Thousands of men, women, and children are scheduled to die very suddenly, without any particular notice being taken of them in the obituary columns.&#x201d;<br><br>The focus of The New Yorker&#x2019;s war reporting is rarely the big picture. Grand strategy is almost never discussed; the Eastern Front, inaccessible to the magazine&#x2019;s reporters, hardly exists; the names Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, and Stalin appear less often than those of ordinary soldiers. The largest event in human history is witnessed in small stories, through details and characters, in what the writer is able to see and hear&#x2014;an elegant third-floor London drawing room exposed by bombing; a tearful conversation between a major and the sergeant he&#x2019;s casually but deeply offended. The neutrality and omniscience of modern newspaper reporting are not the guiding principle here. The writer&#x2019;s personal relation to the subject is often what gives a piece its insight and power. When the playwright S. N. Behrman visits London for the first time since the start of the war, he finds the nightly blackout terrifyingly total and eerily beautiful. Who would have known that London&#x2019;s Underground shelters blasted American pop tunes all night long, if Behrman hadn&#x2019;t made a point of going down into one?<br><br>Liebling&#x2014;corpulent, witty, and pleasure-loving&#x2014;becomes an unlikely correspondent with the U.S. Army in North Africa, and later goes on to cover the landings at Normandy and the liberation of Paris. While the memory of his French pleasures occasionally intrudes, like hunger pangs, Liebling&#x2019;s exuberance is restrained, his comic impulses sobered up, his baroque prose style rendered more straightforward and exact by the vast, death-haunted experience in which he plays a small part.<br><br>The war consumed The New Yorker, along with the rest of the country. Ross begged the War Department for more draft deferments, complaining that he had lost half his editorial staff to military service, and making a case for the magazine&#x2019;s importance to the war effort. In the journalism of the Second World War, the difference between civilian and military dissolved in ways that later became impossible with an all-volunteer army. New Yorker correspondents describe the soldiers they meet by their prewar identity (&#x201c;He was a yacht broker in civilian life and often wrote articles about boats&#x201d;; &#x201c;All Riley wanted to do was finish the war and go back to the University of Texas&#x201d;). A few contributed work to the magazine while still in uniform, while some writers joined the action as if they were members of the unit they were covering. In some of the terse, atmospheric frontline dispatches, it can be hard to tell which was written by a soldier and which by a reporter.<br><br>This closeness between observer and participant is accompanied by an open partisanship that became unthinkable after Vietnam. Panter-Downes says of her English countrymen, &#x201c;The behavior of all classes is so magnificent that no observer here could ever imagine these people following the French into captivity.&#x201d; St. Clair McKelway&#x2019;s series on the strategic bombing of Japan is called &#x201c;A Reporter with the B-29s,&#x201d; but in fact McKelway was a public-affairs officer with the 21st Bomber Command of the Army Air Force&#x2014;an official censor. He referred to the enemy as &#x201c;Japs,&#x201d; never once paused to consider the human cost of the incendiary bombs dropped on Tokyo, and revered the generals who were his direct superiors (including Curtis LeMay), while portraying them with subtlety and humor. In other words, McKelway wrote as a lieutenant colonel whose job was P.R., and who was also a great reporter on the staff of The New Yorker&#x2014;a convergence of roles that would not occur at the magazine today. There&#x2019;s a loss of plausible objectivity in the arrangement, but McKelway wrote about men at war with a frank and knowledgeable love that scarcely appears any longer in American journalism.<br><br>When the war was over, Ross realized that the changes in The New Yorker would be permanent. &#x201c;I think our transition to peace, art, amusement, frivolity, etc., will be gradual,&#x201d; he wrote to Flanner, in June 1946, &#x201c;and probably the magazine will never get back to where it was, on account of having gone heavyweight to a considerable extent during the war.&#x201d; The magazine was about to go even heavier. William Shawn, Ross&#x2019;s deputy (and later his successor), had assigned a young novelist and reporter named John Hersey&#x2014;the son of missionaries in China&#x2014;to travel through occupied Japan and write about the effects of the atomic bomb. &#x201c;Hiroshima&#x201d; filled the entire issue of August 31, 1946.<br><br>Hersey&#x2019;s method of re-creating the destruction of the city through the fate of six individuals produced a daring new form of journalism, modeled on fiction. It portrayed civilians in America&#x2019;s hated enemy, Japan, for the first time as human beings. It rendered the destructive power of nuclear energy all the more terrifying for being brought down to its minute particulars&#x2014;to the flower patterns seared from women&#x2019;s kimonos onto their skin. The Second World War ended with two radical new shocks to human conscience: the death camps and the bomb. The first received its most eloquent testimony from survivors. The second shock was absorbed in the pages of The New Yorker, and transformed into literary art.<br><br>Notes and Comment<br><br>E. B. White<br><br>September 2, 1939<br><br>This will be one of those mute paragraphs written despite the impossible interim of magazine publication, handed over to a linotyper who has already heard later news. Today is Sunday, August 27th. Perhaps you don&#x2019;t remember that far back, you who presumably now dwell in a world which is either at peace or at war. It is three o&#x2019;clock in the morning. The temperature in New York is 70 degrees, sky overcast. The long vigil at the radio is beginning to tell on us. We have been tuned in, off and on, for forty-eight hours, trying to snare intimations of our destiny, as in a butterfly net. Destiny, between musical transcriptions. We still twitch nervously from the likelihood of war at 86 on the dial to the possibility of peace at 100 on the dial. The hours have induced a stupor; we glide from Paris to London to Berlin to Washington&#x2014;from supposition to supposition, lightly. (But that wasn&#x2019;t a supposition, that was the Hotel Astor.) The war of nerves, they call it. It is one of those phrases that catch on. Through it all the radio is immense. It is the box we live in. The world seems very close at hand. (&#x201c;Countless human lives can yet be saved.&#x201d;) We sit with diners at the darkened tables in the French caf�s, we pedal with the cyclists weekending in the beautiful English countryside, we march alongside the German troops approaching the Polish border, we are a schoolboy slipping on his gas mask to take shelter underground from the raid that hasn&#x2019;t come, we sit at the elbow of Sir Nevile as he presents the message to the British Cabinet (but what does it say?). Hour after hour we experience the debilitating sensation of knowing everything in the world except what we want to know&#x2014;as a child who listens endlessly to an adult conversation but cannot get the gist, the one word or phrase that would make all clear. The world, on this Sunday morning, seems pleasingly unreal. We&#x2019;ve been reading (between bulletins) that short story of Tomlinson&#x2019;s called &#x201c;Illusion: 1915,&#x201d; which begins on a summer day in France when the bees were in the limes. But this is Illusion 1939, this radio sandwich on which we chew, two bars of music with an ominous voice in between. And the advertiser, still breaking through: &#x201c;Have you acquired the safety habit?&#x201d; Moscow is calling New York. Hello, New York. Let me whisper I love you. They are removing the pictures from the museums. There was a time when the mere nonexistence of war was enough. Not any more. The world is in the odd position of being intellectually opposed to war, spiritually committed to it. That is the leaden note. If war comes, it will be war, and no one wants that. If peace is restored, it will be another arrangement enlarging not simply the German boundary but the Hitler dream. The world knows it can&#x2019;t win. Let me whisper I love you while we are dancing and the lights are low.<br><br>Paris Postscript<br><br>A. J. Liebling<br><br>August 3/10, 1940 (On the fall of France)<br><br>On Saturday, May 11th, the day after the Germans invaded Holland and Belgium, I had a letter from Jean-Pierre, a corporal in one of the two French armored divisions, which were created after the Polish campaign. They were good divisions, and Jean-Pierre had no way of knowing that the Germans had six times as many. &#x201c;The real rough-house is about to begin,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;So much the better! It will be like bursting an abscess.&#x201d; Jean-Pierre, whose parents were my oldest friends in France, was a strong, quiet boy who in civil life had been a draughtsman in an automobile factory. He liked to play ice hockey and collect marine algae. He had not wanted a soft job in a factory during the war because he did not want to be considered a coward.<br><br>On the same morning I had a telephone conversation with another friend of mine, Captain de Sombreuil, who had just arrived from Alsace on furlough. Upon reaching the Gare de l&#x2019;Est, he had learned that all furloughs were cancelled, so he was going back by the next train. He called me up to say that he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to go to the races at Auteuil with me as he had planned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good that it&#x2019;s starting at last,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We can beat the Boches and have it over with by autumn.&#x201d;<br><br>In the afternoon I went to Auteuil alone. I watched a horse belonging to Senator Hennessy, the cognac man, win the Prix Wild Monarch for three-year-old hurdlers. The track was crowded with people whose main preoccupations seemed to be the new three-year-olds and the new fashions being worn by the women.</p><h2>Silent Treatment: A Novel</h2><p>In his five bestselling novels, from <i>The Sisterhood</i> to <i>Natural Causes</i>, physician Michael Palmer has drawn on years of firsthand emergency-room experience to create the drama of a frighteningly authentic world--a world where the line between medicine and murder is scalpel-thin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in his most harrowing suspense novel yet, Palmer reveals how the power to heal can become a license to kill....<br><br>With his wife, Evie, scheduled for surgery the next day, Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry Corbett goes to the hospital for what he hopes will be a quiet evening of reconciliation.&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent weeks Evie, never quick to share her feelings, has been more closed and distant than ever.<br><br>But when Harry reaches Evie's room, it is too late for reconciliation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shockingly, without warning, Evie is dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;The police suspect homicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;And their only suspect is Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry Corbett.<br><br>Harry is not prepared for the stunning revelations that follow: His bright, beautiful, highly ambitious wife was leading a double life; she may have had<br>dangerous secrets.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what secret could have been explosive enough to die for?<br><br>Then the killer strikes again, boldly, tauntingly murdering one of Harry's favorite patients in such a way that only Harry knows the death was not natural.&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Harry is certain: The killer, medically sophisticated, coolly arrogant, moving undetected through a busy urban hospital, could only be a doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;And he wonders--how many more will die?<br><br>Desperately Harry probes deeper, following the only clue Evie left.&nbsp;&nbsp;What he finds is a sinister pattern that threatens patients in every hospital in the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry is engaged in a life-and-death battle of wits with a chillingly efficient monster.&nbsp;&nbsp;And until the doctor is unmasked, no patient is safe from his lethal silent treatment.<br><br>Michael Palmer has done it again, delivering a no-holds-barred novel of medical intrigue-- a gripping thriller that features the most terrifying physician<br>since Hannibal Lecter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Silent Treatment </i>will keep your pulse racing from beginning to end</p><p><b>Michael Palmer, MD,</b>&nbsp;(1942&#x2013;2013) was the author of&nbsp;<i>Miracle Cure</i>,&nbsp;<i>Critical Judgment</i>,&nbsp;<i>Silent Treatment</i>,&nbsp;<i>Natural Causes</i>,&nbsp;<i>Extreme Measures</i>,&nbsp;<i>Flashback</i>,&nbsp;<i>Side Effects</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Sisterhood.</i> His books have been translated into thirty-five languages.

Feared and reviled, they were a formidable threat to the lands they invaded. Their influence on military history is incalculable: the whole foundation of late Classical and Medieval Western and Middle Eastern military thought was based on the reality of a highly mobile, tough and unconventional foe, one which could strike almost anywhere at will and with highly effective long-range weapons.

But historical investigation in recent years has shown us otherwise. There is evidence that adventurers, explorers, traders, and nomads from various parts of the globe set foot on American soil long before 1492. And expeditions that landed in the Americas reported people already living there&#x2014;indicating that America had been &#x201c;discovered&#x201d; before.<br> Russell Freedman brings his legendary skills as researcher and storyteller to this fresh and intriguing look at the American past.

Mr. Freedman lives in New York City and travels widely to research his books.In this brief look at the first Eurasians to encounter the Americas, Freedman traces the various arguments about who was first and whose influence was felt. Starting with Columbus, he works his way back to the Chinese, the Vikings, and other possible cultures. Though this work is considered to be for the middle school student, adults too will gain new insight into this ongoing historical debate. L.J. Ganser reads the main text with a lively tone and good pacing. However, at times his voice becomes a bit overdramatic when quoting other authors. In these moments one is reminded of old-time radio announcers, with all of their intensity and zeal. This approach may work well with the younger crowd, but adults may be less impressed.

Some of Rome's quiet corners boast breathtaking views, while others are filled with archaeological or architectural details, from crumbling aqueducts or majestic stone archways, to Renaissance garden follies, frescoed walls, and baroque fountains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Author David Downie and photographer Alison Harris climb the Janiculum-the highest hill within Rome's ancient walled fortifications-and find hidden benches with see-forever views; a church forecourt where Goethe sat and sighed, drinking in the inspiration; and the park of a once-noble villa now luxuriantly overgrown, its long trellises knotted with fragrant wisteria and climbing roses. On the Palatine, they find a narrow lane that passes over the ancient ruins, affording rare glimpses of the Forum and Colosseum, free of charge and with no wait. Beyond the Domus Aurea of Emperor Nero, they discover a sweeping staircase from a century ago and the massive brick remains of a temple to Isis.

Entitled <i>A</i> <i>Companion to "The Art of Fugue,"</i> Tovey's commentary was originally published separately from the score; this edition includes the commentary within the same volume as the music. The commentary outlines the contrapuntal devices employed in each of the fugues as well as keen observations on Bach's technical craftsmanship. In addition, Tovey offers insights into the performance of these fugues and suggestions for their programming. Pianists, organists, and all lovers of chamber and Baroque music will appreciate this inexpensive single-volume edition of one of Bach's finest works and a classic commentary.</p><p>Organist, harpsichordist, violinist, and violist Johann Sebastian Bach (1685&#x2013;1750) was among the greatest of Baroque composers. Excelling in sacred and secular music alike, he created enduring works of intellectual, technical, and emotional power.Sir Donald Francis Tovey was a British music analyst, musicologist, critic, composer, conductor, and pianist who specialized in the works of Bach and Beethoven.<br>Andr�s Schiff is a world-famous pianist, a major Bach interpreter, and an expert on Tovey's work.</p><h2>On the Wing: To the Edge of the Earth with the Peregrine Falcon</h2><p>In this extraordinary journey, Alan Tennant recounts his attempt to track the transcontinental migration of the majestic peregrine falcon &#x2014; an investigation no one before him had ever taken to such lengths. From the windswept flats of the Texas barrier islands to the Artic and then south again into the Caribbean, <b>On the Wing</b> provides a hilariously picaresque and bumpy flight.</p><p>On a mission to map the migration of the peregrine falcon, Alan Tennant and his friend George Vose logged thousands of miles in a rattletrap Cessna. <i>On the Wing</i> is as much quest narrative as nature book, and the tale of the two men's voyage is unforgettable. At their first meeting, when Tennant suggested that they track a radio-tagged falcon by air, WWII vet Vose assessed naturalist Tennant with a keen eye. "Aviation takes intestinal fortitude, Mister. You were pretty green up there today. Calm air, too." Nevertheless, Tennant convinced the gruff pilot that the project was worthy, and they set off, soaring north over the dunes of Gulf Coast barrier islands. The falcon was just a beeping signal to them most of the time, but they became obsessed with its movements. In the small cockpit, they shared extremes of disappointment and elation as they dealt with bad weather, lost signals, run-ins with the Army, and equipment problems. They ended up posing as highway patrol officers, crossing international borders, and risking their lives in order to keep on the track of their wayward subject. Threaded into the funny and moving adventure story, Tennant scatters casual snippets of science--peregrine falcon biology, pesticide toxicology, and the little-understood fact of animal migration itself. The facts never get in the way of the fun, though--this is real <i>Wild Kingdom</i> action. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>In this extraordinary narrative, Alan Tennant, a passionate observer of nature, recounts his all-out effort to radio-track the transcontinental migration of the peregrine falcon--an investigation no one before him had ever taken to such lengths. <br>"On the Wing transports us from the windswept flats of the Texas barrier islands--where the tundra falcons pause during their springtime journey north--to the Arctic, and then back south, through Mexico, Belize, and into the Caribbean, in a hilariously picaresque and bumpy flight. At the helm is Tennant's partner in falcon-chasing, George Vose, a septuagenarian World War II vet who trusts his instincts as much as his instruments. As the two men nearly lose their lives and run afoul of the law in the race to keep their birds in view and their rattletrap Cessna gassed up and running, Tennant renders with gorgeous precision and skill the landscape and wildlife they pass on the way and the falcons that direct their course. <br>"On the Wing is a breathtaking encounter with these majestic birds--the icons of pharaohs, Oriental emperors, and European nobility--whose fierce mien, power, and swiftness have fired the human imagination for centuries. An unforgettable and mesmerizing tale that speaks to all our dreams of flight. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Marriage and the Family in the Middle Ages</h2><p><p><strong>From bestselling historians Frances and Joseph Gies, authors of the classic &#x201c;Medieval Life&#x201d; series, comes this compelling, lucid, and highly readable account of the family unit as it evolved throughout the Medieval period&#x2014;reissued for the first time in decades.</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Some particular books that I found useful for <em>Game of Thrones</em> and its sequels deserve mention. <em>Life in a Medieval Castle</em> and <em>Life in a Medieval City</em>, both by Joseph and Frances Gies.&#x201d; &#x2014;George R.

They were a supremely urbane people who longed poetically for the farming life. Valuing toughness and practicality in all things, they turned the love poem into a cynical rebuke and wrote tragedies in which the unfathomable actions of gods gave way to the staggering cruelties of man. As the empire slid into decay, Tacitus pulled back the curtain on the perverse intrigues of the emperors, and a Roman-educated Christian named Augustine recounted his spiritual awakening in what may be the world&#x2019;s first psychological novel.<p>This collection presents the essential writings of the Romans in their finest English translations: the comedies of Terence and Plautus; the histories of Julius Caesar, Livy and Tacitus; the oratory of Cicero; poems by Catullus, Virgil, Horace, and Martial; the philosophy of Lucretius and Bo�thius, along with the stylishly narrated and often ribald myths of Ovid and Apuleius.</p></p><p></p><h2>Alexander Hamilton: A Biography</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;What Mr. McDonald&#x2019;s book does, with exceptional skill and learning, is to re-examine Hamilton&#x2019;s policies as secretary of the treasury.

Had they known what a fickle muse Clio would prove to be, they might have been more anxious. The making of myths and legends, complete with a hagiology and demonology, is inherent in the process of evolution toward nationhood. Consequently, individual actors in the original drama have often been consigned by History to roles they did not actually play, and the most important of them have played shifting roles, being heroes in one generation and villains in the next. It is therefore not surprising that Alexander Hamilton&#x2015;along with Washington, Jefferson, Adams, and Madison&#x2015;has had his ups and downs at the hands of historians.</p><p>This book re-examines Hamilton&#39;s policies as a secretary of the treasury.

Culminating in Hitler's historic climb to totalitarian reign, this period marks his progression through the shifting political maze of the Weimar Republic and the tumultuous rise of the Nazi Party. Far from an irresistible force of politics, Hitler's passage was one underscored by personal power plays, economic instability, gloating triumphs, and near failures. <br><br>A political chapter that spans Germany's wobbly recovery from World War I through years of growing prosperity and crippling depression, this period marks Hitler's unrelenting struggle for control over his radical, raucous movement. It includes brushes with power and quests for revenge, nonstop electioneering and American-style campaign tactics and, for Hitler, moments of immense success and feared humiliation.<br>Following an improbable, serpentine journey, <i>The Unfathomable Ascent</i> is a complex story with one dangerous climax: Hitler's sweeping ascent into political power, and the western world's descent into historic darkness.</p><p><b>Peter Ross Range</b> is a world-traveled journalist who has covered war, politics, and international affairs.

These powers, or some of them, have been brought into the research laboratories of the para-psychologists who call them extra-sensory perception and psycho-kinesis. Others call them miracles. Whatever the terminology, such powers and their practitioners demand sensible attention. This account relates some of the achievements of one of the most impressive men of miracles to appear in centuries. Satya Sai Baba--his followers believe him to be a reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi who died in 1918--appears to have been born with phenomenal powers, which he used in childhood and has employed constantly and openly ever since. They include all the varieties of E.S.P. and P.K. known to psychic science and more besides. The author, a Westerner devoted to science and logic, spent many months with Satya Said Baba; he claims to have found that his &#34;unscientific,&#34; &#34;illogical&#34; miracles were, in fact, genuine yogic siddhis.

Daniel had never liked riding in taxis. It seemed the height of ridiculousness to trust one's life to a total stranger who more often than not hailed from a distant Third World country and frequently was more interested in talking on his cell phone than paying attention to driving. Sitting in the middle of M Street an the darkness with rush-hour traffic whizzing, by on both sides and the driver carrying on emotionally in an unknown language was a case in point. Daniel glanced over at Stephanie. She appeared relaxed and smiled at him in the half-light. She gripped his hand affectionately. </p><p> It was only by leaning forward that Daniel could see there was a traffic light suspended from above to facilitate a rather awkward mid-block left-hand turn. Glancing at the other side of the street, he could see a driveway leading to a nondescript, boxy brick building. </p><p> "Is this the hotel?" Daniel questioned. "If it is, it doesn't look much like a hotel." </p><p> "Let's hold our evaluation until we have a little more data," Stephanie responded in a playful tone. </p><p> The light changed and the taxi leapt forward like a racehorse out of the gate. The driver only had one hand on the steering wheel as he accelerated through the turn. Daniel steadied himself to keep from being thrown against the car door. After a big bounce over the junction of the street and the hotel's driveway, and then another sharp left-hand turn beneath the hotel's porte cochere, the driver braked hard enough to put significant tension on Daniel's seat belt. A moment later, Daniel's door was pulled open. </p><p> "Welcome to the Four Seasons," a liveried doorman said brightly. "Are you checking in?" </p><p> Leaving their luggage in the hands of the doorman, Daniel and Stephanie entered the hotel lobby and headed toward the registration desk. They passed a grouping of statuary fit for a modern art museum. The carpet was thick and luxurious. Smartly dressed people lounged in overstuffed velvet chairs. </p><p> "How did you talk me into staying here?" Daniel questioned rhetorically. "The outside might be plain, but the interior suggests this is going to be expensive." </p><p> Stephanie pulled Daniel to a halt. "Are you trying to suggest that you've forgotten our conversation yesterday?" </p><p> "We had a lot of conversations yesterday," Daniel muttered. He noticed the woman who had just walked by carrying a French poodle had a diamond engagement ring the size of a Ping-Pong ball. </p><p> "You know what I'm talking about!" Stephanie proclaimed. She reached up and turned Daniel's face toward her own. "We decided to make the best of this trip. We're staying in this hotel for two nights, and we're going to indulge ourselves and, I would hope, each other." </p><p> Catching Stephanie's witty licentiousness, Daniel smiled in spite of himself. </p><p> "Your testifying tomorrow in front of Senator Butler's Health Policy Subcommittee is not going to be a walk in the park," Stephanie continued. "That's a given. But in spite of what happens there, we're going to at least take the memory of a nice experience back to Cambridge." </p><p> "Couldn't we have had a nice experience at a slightly less extravagant hotel?" </p><p> "Not in my book," Stephanie declared. "They have a health club, a masseuse, and top-rated room service, all of which we're going to take advantage of. So start relaxing and unwinding. Besides, I'll pick up the tab." </p><p> "Really?" </p><p> "Sure! With the salary I've been pulling down, I should give some back to the company." </p><p> "Oh, that's a low blow!" Daniel remarked playfully, while pretending to reel from a make-believe slap. </p><p> "Look," Stephanie said, "I know the company hasn't been exactly able to pay our salaries for a while, but I'm going to see that this whole trip goes on the company charge card. If things go really badly tomorrow which they very well might, bankruptcy court can decide how much the Four Seasons will be paid for our indulgence." </p><p> Daniel's smile erupted into a full laugh. "Stephanie, you never fail to amaze me!" </p><p> "You ain't seen nothing yet," Stephanie said with a smile. "The question is: Are you going to let your hair down or what? Even in the taxi, I could tell you were wound up like a piano wire." </p><p> "That was because I was worried about whether we were going to get here in one piece, not how we were going to pay for it." </p><p> "Come on, big spender," Stephanie said, urging Daniel forward. "Let's get up to our suite." </p><p> "Suite?" Daniel questioned, as he allowed himself to be dragged toward the registration desk. </p><p> Stephanie hadn't exaggerated. Their suite overlooked a part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal with the Potomac River in the background. On the coffee table in the sitting room was a cooler chilling a bottle of champagne. Vases of freshly cut flowers graced the bureau in the bedroom and the expansive countertop in the generous-size marble bathroom. </p><p> As soon as the bellman disappeared, Stephanie put her arms around Daniel. Her dark eyes stared up into his blue orbs. A slight smile played across her full lips. "I know you are under a lot of stress about tomorrow," she began, "so how about letting me be the tour leader? We both know that Senator Butler's proposed legislation would effectively outlaw your patented and brilliant procedure. And that would mean a cancellation of the second-round financing for the company, with obviously disastrous consequences. With that said and understood, let's forget about it for tonight. Can you do that?" </p><p> "I can try," Daniel said, although he knew it would be impossible. Failure was one of his worst fears. </p><p> "That's all I ask," Stephanie said. She gave him a quick kiss before breaking away to attend to the champagne. "Here's the schedule! We have a glass of bubbly, then take refreshing showers. Following that, we have reservations at a nearby restaurant called Citronelle that I hear is fantastic. After a wonderful meal, we come back here and make mad, passionate love. What do you say?" </p><p> "I'd be crazy to offer any resistance," Daniel said, raising his hands in mock surrender. </p><p> Stephanie and Daniel had been living together for more than two years and had developed a comfortable familiarity. They had noticed each other back in the mid-eighties, when Daniel had returned to academia and Stephanie was an undergraduate chemistry major at Harvard. Neither acted on their mutual attraction, since such liaisons were specifically frowned upon by university policy. Besides, neither had had the slightest notion that their feelings were reciprocal, at least not until Stephanie had completed her Ph.D. and had joined the junior faculty, giving them an opportunity to interact on more equal footing. Even their respective areas of scientific expertise complemented each other. When Daniel left the university to found his company, it was natural that Stephanie would accompany him. </p><p> "Not bad at all," Stephanie said, after she drained her flute and put the glass down on the coffee table. "Now! Let's flip to see who gets the shower first." </p><p> "No need to flip a coin," Daniel said, placing his empty glass next to Stephanie's. "I concede. You first. While you shower, I'll shave." </p><p> "You've got a deal," Stephanie said. </p><p> Daniel didn't know if it was the champagne or Stephanie's infectious buoyancy but he felt significantly less tense, although hardly less worried, as he lathered his face and began shaving. Having had only one glass, he suspected it was Stephanie. As she had implied, the morrow might bring disaster, a fear disturbingly reminiscent of Heinrich Wortheim's prophecy the day he'd discovered Daniel was moving back to private industry. But Daniel would try not to allow such thoughts to dominate their visit, at least for that evening. He would try to follow Stephanie's lead and enjoy himself. </p><p> Looking beyond his lathered image in the mirror, Daniel could see Stephanie's blurred figure through the misted glass-enclosed shower. Her singing voice could be heard over the roar of the water. She was thirty-six but looked more like twenty-six. As he had told her on more than one occasion, she'd done very well in the genetic lottery. Her tall, curvaceous figure was slender and firm as if she worked out regularly even though she didn't, and her dark, olive skin was nearly blemish-free. A mat of thick, lustrous dark hair with matching midnight eyes completed the picture. </p><p> The shower door opened, and Stephanie stepped out. She briskly dried her hair, totally unconcerned about her nakedness. For a moment, she bent over at the waist, allowing her hair to fall free as she frenetically rubbed it with the towel. Then she stood back uptight, flipping her hair back in the process like a horse redirecting its mane. When she switched to drying her back with a provocative wiggle of her hips, her line of sight happened to catch Daniel's stare in the mirror. She stopped. </p><p> "Hey!" Stephanie exclaimed. "What are you looking at? You're supposed to be shaving." Suddenly self-conscious, she wrapped herself in her towel as if it were a strapless minidress. </p><p> Initially embarrassed about being caught as a voyeur, Daniel quickly regained his equanimity. He put down his razor and stepped over to Stephanie. He gripped her shoulders and stared into her liquid-onyx eyes. "I just couldn't help but notice how sexy and absolutely alluring you look." </p><p> Stephanie tilted her head to the side to get a view of Daniel from a slightly different perspective. "Are you all right?" </p><p> Daniel laughed. "I'm fine." </p><p> "Did you slip back to the sitting room and polish off that bottle of champagne?" </p><p> "I'm being serious." </p><p> "You haven't said anything like that for months." </p><p> "To say I've been preoccupied would be putting it mildly. </p><p> </p><p> When I had the idea of founding the company, I had no idea that fund-raising was going to occupy one hundred and ten percent of my efforts. And now on top of it comes this political menace, threatening to destroy the whole operation." </p><p> "I understand," Stephanie said. "Truly I do, and I haven't taken it personally." </p><p> "Has it really been months?" </p><p> "Trust me," Stephanie said, nodding her head for emphasis. </p><p> "I apologize," Daniel said. "And to show my remorse, I'd like to make a motion to change the evening's schedule. I propose that we move up the lovemaking and put the dinner plans on hold. Do I hear a second?" </p><p> As Daniel tried to lean down to give Stephanie a playful kiss, she pushed his still-lathered face back with just the tip of her index finger on his nose. Her expression suggested she was touching something remarkably distasteful, especially as she wiped the bit of lather from her finger onto his shoulder. "Parliamentary rules are not going to maneuver this lady out of a good dinner," she remarked. "It took some effort to get those reservations, so the evening's plans hold as previously voted on and passed. Now back to shaving!" She gave him a spirited shove toward the sink, then stepped to the neighboring sink to dry her hair. </p><p> "Kidding aside," Daniel yelled over the sound of the hair dryer when he'd finished shaving. "You do look fantastic. Sometimes I wonder what you see in an old man like me." He patted his cheeks with aftershave lotion. </p><p> "Fifty-two is hardly old," Stephanie yelled back. "Particularly as active as you are. Actually, you're pretty sexy yourself." </p><p> Daniel regarded himself in the mirror. He thought he didn't look too bad, although he wasn't going to fool himself by imagining he was in any way sexy. Long ago, he'd reconciled himself to the fact that he was on the nerdy side of the equation of life, having grown up as a science prodigy since the sixth grade. Stephanie was just trying to be nice. He'd always had a thin face, so at least there was no problem with developing jowls or even wrinkles, save for some mild crow's feet at the corner of his eyes when he smiled. He'd stayed active physically, although not so much over the previous several months, due to the time constraints of fund-raising. As a faculty member at Harvard, he'd taken full advantage of the athletic facilities, using the squash and handball courts regularly, as well as the rowing opportunities on the Charles River. His only real appearance problem as he saw it was the retreating hairline at the upper corners of his forehead and the thinning area of his crown, plus the salt-and-pepper silvering of his otherwise brown hair along the sides of his head, but there wasn't much he could do about all that. </p><p> After both of them had finished primping, dressing, and donning their coats, they left the hotel armed with simple directions to the restaurant obtained from the concierge. Arm in arm, they strolled several blocks west along M Street, passing a potpourri of art galleries, bookshops, and antiques stores. The night was crisp but not too cold, with a canopy of stars visible despite the city lights. </p><p> The ma�tre d' at the restaurant led them to a table off to the side that afforded a degree of privacy in the busy establishment. They ordered food and a bottle of wine, and settled back for a romantic dinner. By the time the entrees had been served and they both had had fun remembering their mutual attraction prior to their ever having dated, they lapsed into a contented silence. Unfortunately Daniel broke it. </p><p> "I probably shouldn't bring this up ..." Daniel began. </p><p> "Then don't," Stephanie interjected, having an immediate inclination of where Daniel was heading. </p><p> "But I should," Daniel said. "In fact, I have to, and this is a better time than later. Several days ago, you said you were going to research our tormentor, Senator Ashley Butler, with the idea of possibly giving me some help for tomorrow's hearing. I know you looked into it, but you didn't say anything. How come?" </p><p> "My recollection is that you agreed to forget about the hearing for tonight." </p><p> "I agreed to try to forget about the hearing," Daniel corrected. "I haven't been totally successful. Did you not bring up what you learned because you didn't find anything helpful or what? Help me here, and then we can put it all aside for the rest of the night." </p><p> Stephanie looked off for a few beats to organize her thoughts. "What do you want to know?" </p><p> Daniel let out a short, exasperated laugh. "You're making this more difficult than it needs to be. To be truthful, I don't know what I want to know, because I don't know enough to even ask questions." </p><p> "He's not going to be easy." </p><p> "We already had that impression." </p><p> "He's been in the senate since 1972, and his seniority gives him significant clout." </p><p> "I'd assumed as much, since he's the chairman of the subcommittee," Daniel said.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>The Everything Wedding Organizer: Checklists, charts, and worksheets for planning the perfect day!</h2><p><b>All you need for planning the wedding of your dreams!</b><br><br> Finding the right venue.

But the house has a life of its own. Abandoned for the last forty years, surrounded by thick trees and a stifling sense of melancholy, the sprawling Victorian house seems to swallow up the sunlight. Deep within the cold cellar and etched into the very walls is a long, dark history of the Conway name--a grim bloodline poisoned by suicide, strange disappearances, voodoo rituals, and rumors of murder. But the family knows nothing of the soul-shattering secrets that snake through generations of their past. They do not know that terror awaits them. For with each generation of the Conways comes a hellish day of reckoning. . . .</p><p>John Saul has been giving readers the jitters since the publication of <i>Suffer the Children</i> in 1977. His 22nd twisted tale, <i>The Right Hand of Evil</i> is another nerve shaker.<p> The Conway family is in deep financial trouble. Ted Conway would rather knock back bourbon than support his family, and Janet Conway's career as an artist is going nowhere. Happily, the three Conway children--toddler Molly and 15-year-old twins Jared and Kimberley--seem well adjusted. Of course happy children to not make for good horror material, so dark times are just around the corner. </p><p> Ted receives an unexpected call from a Louisiana sanatorium, where his aged Aunt Cora is dying. Cora wants to convey a final message to her only surviving family members. She rasps out the ominous words, "I can see it. Stay away! Stay away from here!" Her words are futile--the financially strapped Ted moves his family into Cora's old house, a house deeded to them in a family trust. </p><p> Young Kimberley instantly feels a dark presence in the dilapidated Victorian house: "Suddenly her skin was crawling, as if a large insect were creeping across her neck." Tragedy upon tragedy strikes the family. Kim's beloved cat disappears and is sacrificed in a black-magic ceremony; an evil presence takes over Jared's mind--transforming him into the most rotten of bad seeds; the wails of a dead infant fill Kim's head, driving her to the edge of insanity. The family has fallen victim to a centuries-old curse--a curse that threatens to wipe out the Conway name.</p><p> Although there is nothing particularly original or earth shattering about this haunted-house story, <i>The Right Hand of Evil</i> is still a welcome piece of escapism. Read it at your peril. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>JOHN SAUL&#39;s first novel, Suffer the Children, published in 1977, was an immediate million-copy bestseller. He has since written twenty successive bestselling novels of suspense, including The Presence, Black Lightning, Guardian, The Homing, and most recently Shadow Sister. He is also the author of the New York Times bestselling serial thriller The Blackstone Chronicles, initially published in six installments, but now available in one complete volume.

It is Luther&#39;s response to Desiderius Erasmus&#39; Diatribe on Free Will, written in his direct and unique style, combining deep spirituality with humor.Martin Luther (1483-1546) initiated the Protestant Reformation. As a priest and theology professor, he confronted indulgence salesman Johann Tetzel with his The Ninety-Five Theses in 1517. Luther strongly disputed their claim that freedom from God&#39;s punishment of sin could be purchased with money. His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Edict of Worms meeting in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the emperor. Martin Luther taught that salvation is not from good works, but a free gift of God, received only by grace through faith in Jesus as redeemer from sin. His theology challenged the authority of the pope of the Roman Catholic Church by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptised Christians to be a holy priesthood. Those who identify with Luther&#39;s teachings are called Lutherans. His translation of the Bible into the language of the people (instead of Latin) made it more accessible, causing a tremendous impact on the church and on German culture. It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language, added several principles to the art of translation, and influenced the translation into English of the King James Bible. His hymns inspired the development of singing in churches. His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage, allowing Protestant priests to marry.</p><h2>The Last Apprentice: Fury of the Seventh Son (Book 13) (Last Apprentice, 13)</h2><p><p>The thirteenth&#x2014;and final&#x2014;book in the internationally bestselling fantasy adventure series that inspired the forthcoming major motion picture <em>Seventh Son</em>.

While most known as a crucial component of the "jungle alchemy" that is ayahuasca, DMT is a unique story unto itself. Until now, this story has remained untold. <i>Mystery School in Hyperspace</i> is the first book to delve into the history of this substance, the discovery of its properties, and the impact it has had on poets, artists, and musicians. <br><br> DMT has appeared at crucial junctures in countercultural history. William Burroughs was jacking the spice in Tangier at the turn of the 1960s.<b> </b>It was present at the meeting between Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters and Tim Leary's associates. It guided the inception of the Grateful Dead in 1965. It showed up in Berkeley in the same year, falling into the hands of Terence McKenna, who would eventually become its champion in the post-rave neo-psychedelic movement of the 1990s. Its indole vapor drifted through Portugal's Boom Festival and has been evident at Nevada's Burning Man, where DMT has been adopted as spiritual technology supplying shape, color, and depth to a visionary art movement. The growing prevalence of use is evident in a vast networked independent research culture, and in its impact on fiction, film, music and metaphysics. As this book traces the effect of DMT's release into the cultural bloodstream, the results should be of great interest to contemporary readers. <br><br> The book permits a broad reading audience to join ongoing debates in studies in consciousness and theology where the brain is held to be either a generator or a receiver of consciousness. The implications of the "spirit molecule" or "the brain's own psychedelic" among other theories illustrate that DMT may lift the lid on the Pandora's Box of consciousness. <br><br> Features a foreword by Dennis McKenna, cover art by Beau Deeley, and thirty color illustrations by various artists, including Alex Grey, Android Jones, Martina Hoffmann, Luke Brown, Carey Thompson, Adam Scott Miller, Randal Roberts, along with Jay Bryan, Cyb, Orryelle Defenestrate-Bascule, Art Van D'lay, Stuart Griggs, Jay Lincoln, Gwyllm Llwydd, Shiptu Shaboo, Marianna Stelmach, and Mister Strange.<br><br> Regarded as the "nightmare hallucinogen" or celebrated as the "spirit molecule," labelled "psychotogenic" or "entheogenic," considered a dangerous drug or the suspected X-factor in the evolution of consciousness, DMT is a powerful enigma. Documenting the scientists and artists drawn into its sphere of influence, navigating the liminal aesthetics of the "breakthrough" experience, tracing the novum of "hyperspace" in esoteric and science fiction currents, <i>Mystery School in Hyperspace </i>excavates the significance of this enigmatic phenomenon in the modern world.<br><br> Exposing a great many myths, this cultural history reveals how DMT has had a beneficial influence on the lives of those belonging to a vast underground network whose reports and initiatives expose drug war propaganda and shine a light in the shadows. This conversation is highly relevant at a time when significant advances are being made to lift the moratorium on human research with psychedelics.<br> Read the first chapter "DMT: An Enigma Wrapped in a Mystery".

Seriously. Do you have any idea what it's like to be a ninja? Unless you're a ninja the answer is no. Got it?<br><br>Welcome to the International Order of Ninjas, a tradition of death.<br><br>Right now, unless you are rereading this book for nostalgia, you are a non--ninja with great aspirations toward all things ninja. You are excited about diving in and attacking the path of the ninja with the vigor of the untrustworthy crion.* Depending on how long you remain living or livingish, you will gradually work your way from nothing to nonja, ninjaish, ninjalike, Whoooooooo, and finally I.T.A.N. (Is That a Ninja), the highest level of ninjaness any non--ninja can hope to achieve. Should you reach the exalted status of I.T.A.N. and wish to progress further, the skills and general knowledge contained later in the book can be used in your attempt to become a fully authorized, I.O.N.--endorsed, full--time ninja.<br><br>But, as they say, let's not count our dragon eggs before they poison our crion soup.<br><br>Along your path, you will run and jump and dive out of the way. You will test parts of your person that you do not yet know are parts of your person.<br><br>Ever heard of your "huh"?<br><br>Exactly.<br><br>You have one, and very soon you will be using it like crazy, unless you want your nickname to be Ol' Splatter Guts.<br><br>As you move along the ninja path, this book will act not only as a guide, but also as a friend_._._._a very very dangerous friend that you would never turn your back on.<br><br>THE NINJA PATH promises great pain beyond your current conceivable definition. You will study your will up close and learn how threshold is a sliding scale of sanity.<br>THE NINJA PATH promises skills and the masters to help you master those skills. Skills that if you do not master will most likely lead to a maimed or dead you. Masters who if you do not master the skills they teach will most likely maim or dead you.<br>THE NINJA PATH promises chance. If we go any further into this at this time, it would negate the very nature of the chance the ninja path promises.<br>THE NINJA PATH promises death. We were gonna say near--certain death, but why sugarcoat it. Knowing that death is imminent will constantly keep you on your toes. Toes that may very well bring upon the very death you are promised. A promise you will never call us on keeping unless you are an idiot, in which case we'll hop on that promise like ineffectual environmentalism on suburbia.<br>THE NINJA PATH promises experiences. Some that will cause even your knees to crack open and vomit. Some that you will wish you could give back or grow back. Some that you actually can give back, grow back, or at least swap with an akuma* in the altered state of beans.<br><br>While pursuing the ninja path, it is good to keep in mind a bit of advice, advice that we ninjas like to call serious threats:<br><br>If you blibber--blab about your enlightenment and techniques, we will kill you.<br><br>If you participate in a major motion picture in which the secrets of the ninja are explained and demonstrated within a wacky plot that involves a distant father and a child with extremely dated hair, we will kill you.<br><br>If you dress up like a ninja every day and/or start an online show where you dole out "ninja answers," we will kill you and/or syndicate you.<br><br>Remember, but never speak, the words of the nameless ninja from www.askaninja.com, "Ninjas don't kill people_._._._ninjas kill people very very well."<br><br>For your journey, this book will be your guide. We suggest fashioning some sort of clip device to keep this book in front of you at all times. You will absolutely never know when you are going to need its wisdom. Aside from this book, you may want to start a den of ninjiquity that includes other ninjaphiles and wannabes. These should be people that you don't mind hanging out with a lot, but that you also -wouldn't feel bad leaving inside a giant radioactive turkey if things happened to go that way.<br><br>Let's put the best possible face on it and call the path of the ninja an adventure. Are you ready for the adventure? If you answered yes, you are a fool who only momentarily has his/her head attached to his/ her body. If you answered no, you are a pathetic and weak creature ambling along toward the cannon's mouth of ignorance whose highest aspiration should be one day consuming some<br><br>animal--shaped crackers.<br><br>If you did not answer and in fact are not even reading this because you have already turned the page, you have a minuscule chance at becoming a ninja.<br><br>Let's begin!<br>Ninjaing, like most things in life and death, is more fun when you have people to share it with. That is why it is strongly suggested that you start a clan.<br><br>What Makes a Clan?<br><br>1. ONE OR MORE PEOPLE committed to the pursuit of all things ninja.<br><br>2. A NAME that sounds both honorable and deadly. This can take some investigation.<br><br>First, you have to check the name against the Ninja Clan Registry to make sure it's original. We only have to look at the debacle with the Flying Hound Clans to realize the importance of that. Four clans took that same name. No one knew who was killing what or why or how. They all ended up in a dogfight battling one another for the name. One member from one clan survived and was killed one week later by a cerberus.<br><br>Second, make sure the name fits your clan.<br><br>This may seem obvious, but for some reason tons of clans put "monkey" in their name when it has nothing to do with their style of killing people. If you call yourself the Skateboard Pain Clan, you'd better not start riding Segways next month.<br><br>Third, your clan name should be relatively short and have two components: (1) the most applicable and universal noun associated to your clan member(s) and (2) a powerful verb or adjective that fits with the noun and -doesn't currently have an embarrassing second meaning. You do not want to end up like the Clan of the Five Knuckle Shufflers.<br><br>Here is a helpful table for narrowing down possible clan names.<br><br>First, use petty infighting and irrational arguments with your clan members to narrow your potential clan--name components down to a maximum of 10 for each of the above categories. Then mix and match the components until the best name naturally presents<br><br>itself.<br><br>Using even the few examples above, there are many potential clan names. Most of them are pretty bad: Truck--Shaped Olive Clan (the visual is too hard to conjure and once imagined -doesn't really instill any real fear or dread), Clan of the Papaya Whip Stymphalian Bird (just a scooch too long and would probably be better fit for a dessert at Bennigan's), Pitchfork Shoebox Clan (maybe if you were a country fusion band in the mid--1970s). Then there are a few that sound okay, but aren't quite right: Clan of the Basting Lynda Carter (sexy and hot, but a bit too relaxed and somewhat cannibalistic), the Papaya Whip Pitchfork Clan (exciting and in motion, but the color is too urban for such a rural weapon). The obvious and best named that can be formed from the examples is the Clan of the Basting Shoebox. What's in that shoebox? Why is that shoebox basting? Is the thing inside the shoebox basting too? I don't think I'm going to mess with that shoebox until I get more information. These are the type of thoughts you want your enemies to have when they hear you name.<br><br>3. ONCE YOU HAVE A NAME, you need an oath, something simple and straightforward that boldly states the mission of the clan and what sets this clan apart from other clans. Here are a few sample oaths from real ninja clans.<br><br>CLAN OF THE FATAL FOG<br><br>On the life of Blake I swear<br><br>I shall move like water on air<br><br>I shall not be seen coming or going<br><br>I shall surround without anyone knowing<br><br>I shall not be touched but touch at will<br><br>I shall pay a 10% royalty to John Carpenter for each thing I kill<br><br>PHOENIX FIRE CLAN<br><br>With fire I pledge<br><br>I shall kill other people at all times<br><br>I shall keep myself physically, mentally,<br><br>and morally flexible<br><br>I shall never die for real<br><br>DUDES OF DEATH CLAN<br><br>I will do my thing no matter the deal<br><br>Whatever the mess, I will roll as I roll<br><br>On the vibes of honor I will ride<br><br>Killer will be as killer as I am<br><br>4. ONCE YOU HAVE PEOPLE, a name, and an oath, now you need to combine all of those things into a kick--butt flag or crest. Some sort of visual emblem expressed in hot melt--glued felt that will represent and endure for the length of your ninjafication.<br><br>Let's Make a Flag<br><br>Design: The first rule of design has always been "simple is better, but too simple is dumb." You will not truly know if your design is good until it's too late and you're already being judged by it. That bit of encouragement should offer you the bravery and license to really go for it in the design phase. Take the boldest aspirations of your clan and boil them down into powerful clear images. Do not choose any image without experiencing it firsthand. For example, if you think that pain is a big part of what your clan is about, take some time to really explore exactly what painful thing represents you specifically. Put on your painful thinking caps. Is it a buggane*? Go to the Isle of Man and meet one. Watch him tear the arms off of someone. Do their screams epitomize the screams you wish to induce? Maybe you equate pain with a unicorn on fire. Light one up, ride it around for a while. How bad does it hurt? Perhaps it's an object like a pillow soaked in acid. If that's the case, what kind of acid?<br><br>This is your flag. Do your homework. Make sure whatever you pick is enduring. One particularly regretful clan chose Mickey Mouse Club-era Christina Aguilera as their emblem of virtue.

YOU WILL DESIGN a flippin' wicked, dynamic, kick--ass flag in your mind, but will lack the general skills, talent, and vocabulary to represent it in any way to anyone.<br><br>2. YOU WILL ASK your mom if she can sew or work a hot--glue gun. (Note: If a mom is not available, go to the nearest flea market and look for a lady with a picture of her cat on her sweatshirt.)<br><br>3. SHE WILL TAKE you to Thimblina's Fabric Supply Store where you will purchase about $40 of random crap.<br><br>4. YOU WILL DESCRIBE with animated gestures the symbols and ferocity that belong on your clan's flag.<br><br>5. YOUR MOTHER (OR crazy cat--craft lady) will propose some alternate ideas. You will get into an argument about the appropriateness of the symbols. You will take a box of crackers and go up to your room sulking and immediately regret choosing crackers instead of cookies and not bringing anything to drink.<br><br>6. YOU COME DOWNSTAIRS only to find that the flag materials have been put in that giant plastic tub where most of your family's unfinished projects go to die. You apologize and barter three weeks of allowance or cat sitting to get your creative partner to pull it out and make your awesome flag that you really really really want.<br><br>7. YOU WILL THEN watch carefully as your mother (or wirehaired Insanknitty club member) botches everything up and shows no ability to powerfully or even remotely represent in fabric the glorious wonderfulness and genius you envisioned.<br><br>8. YOU AWKWARDLY THANK her as you accept the stupid thing. You hide the flag in your school locker or work cubicle, lying to your clan members about ever saying, "No, I'm making the flag. I've got an awesome idea and_._._._Yeah, it's gonna have these things. It's gonna be insane."<br><br>Don't worry about it. You are completely non--ninja right now. Soon you will have the skill and power to make that breathtakingly rockin' flag the way you originally imagined it. All will gaze upon it in astonishment and many eyes will explode.</p><h2>Pam the Jam: The Book of Preserves</h2><p><p>-<br><b>'Pam Corbin is the master, and the first person I turn to for everything to do with preserving. I've learnt so much from her' </b><br><b>- DIANA HENRY</b></p><p>Pam Corbin is the expert who professional cooks consult when they want to make jams, jellies, marmalades, chutneys, pickles or anything else to do with preserving. They know her as 'Pam the Jam', and this book is the culmination of her years of experience, distilled into more than 100 tried-and-tested recipes. Her jams, marmalades and fruit spreads contain far less sugar than traditional recipes, which means that they taste astonishingly fruity and delicious. Likewise, her chutneys and pickles are lighter and sprightlier than the old-fashioned kind. </p><p>Pam will show you how to make more unusual preserves too - such as glossy fruit cheeses to serve with everything from Stilton to manchego (which calls for her classic quince membrillo). Or creamy yet zesty fruit curd: there's a recipe for classic lemon curd, and also a wonderfully light lime and coconut one. </p><p>If you have an array of Pam's preserves in your store cupboard, you can transform any meal in an instant. She'll inspire you to dig into your jars of preserves to make spin-off recipes such as scrumptious lime cheesecake, cherry pie or spicy sausage rolls. Packed with detailed instructions, explanations and tips, this is the only preserve-making bible that you will ever need.</p></p><p></p><h2>Aboriginal Men of High Degree: Initiation and Sorcery in the World&#39;s Oldest Tradition</h2><p>The first book to reveal the secret and sacred practices of Aboriginal shamans, <i>Aboriginal Men of High Degree</i> presents an extraordinary series of rites by which the young Aboriginal male begins the degrees of shamanic initiation--each marked by its own portion of esoteric knowledge. One of Australia's most eminent anthropologists, A. P.

Second, this book is dedicated to calling the North American church to take seriously its charge not simply to love the &#34;stranger and alien&#34; but to live as &#34;strangers and aliens&#34; within the American nation to which it has been called to witness to Jesus Christ.</p><p>Michael Pasquale is Associate Professor of Linguistics and Chair of the Humanities Division at Cornerstone University, Grand Rapids, Michigan.

When the husband of a colleague quietly gives him a copy of the classified work she was doing before her mysterious suicide, Draman finally sees a glimmer of hope. Its stunning conclusions have the potential to not only turn the field of biology on its head but reshape the world. Soon, though, he finds himself on the run, relentlessly pursued by a seemingly omnipotent group of men who will do whatever it takes to silence him.</p><p><strong>A Q&amp;A with Kyle Mills</strong><br> <br><strong>Question: </strong><em>The Immortalists</em> is the story of a billionaire&#x2019;s desire to stop aging. What was your inspiration for this unique take on the age-old fountain of youth tale? <p><strong>Kyle Mills: </strong>The myth of the fountain of youth is one of the oldest and most widespread in history, with writing on the subject dating back before Christ. The one thing that all those stories and elaborate quests had in common was that they were nonsense--just another example of our superstitious nature. With all the recent advances in genetics, though, the myth is quickly becoming a reality. Not many people know it, but not all animals get old. Lobsters, for instance, just seem to keep going until they get sick or something eats them. The idea that we could identify the portion of their genome that provides longevity and splice it into our own becomes less far-fetched every day.</p> <p>This brings up a lot of interesting issues. Our history isn&#x2019;t exactly one of equality and benevolence, and death is hard-wired into our minds and societies. Will the people who discover this therapy pass it along to everyone, or will they try to keep it for themselves? Would our population explode if life expectancy suddenly rose to 500 years or more? Would advancement grind to a halt if scientists and politicians consolidated their positions, then stagnated in them for centuries? Would our existence become less life and more a tedious, endless avoidance of death? All this is perfect fodder for a thriller because change can very easily turn into chaos, and chaos makes for great stories.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>What kind of research goes into writing an in-depth medical thriller?</p> <p><strong>KM: </strong>I spent a number of months on research before putting pen to paper. The main character&#x2019;s daughter suffers from a rare genetic disease that causes her to age at a wildly accelerated rate. The disease, a real syndrome called progeria, generates some fascinating questions about the causes of aging and whether it can simply be &#x201c;cured.&#x201d; Unfortunately for my friends and family, I am now a fount of useless information about genetics and aging, but I think that extra effort gave <em>The Immortalists</em> its realism and the sense that it could actually be happening right now. In truth, it probably could.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>You recently stepped into Robert Ludlum&#x2019;s Covert-One series by writing <em>The Ares Decision</em>. What is it like to become part of such a rich canon with a devoted readership?</p> <p><strong>KM: </strong>A bit frightening. I have to admit I almost didn&#x2019;t accept the job--those are pretty big shoes to fill. But in the end, I&#x2019;m glad I did. It was a really fun project, and I found that I still could learn a thing or two by studying the works of one of the genre&#x2019;s masters. Even better, Ludlum&#x2019;s fans have been really enthusiastic about <em>The Ares Decision</em>, and I think I came out of the project a stronger writer.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Your father was an FBI agent. How much does that background find its way into your writing?</p> <p><strong>KM: </strong>A great deal. Spending so many years hanging around FBI and CIA agents, soldiers, and diplomats gave me an inherent sense of what makes them tick. It also gave me a long list of people I can contact when I need the final word on how that world works.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>What are you working on now?</p> <p><strong>KM: </strong>A new installment of Robert Ludlum&#x2019;s Covert-One series. It&#x2019;s a novel about a new technology that I think will be the next step in human evolution. Of course, the question becomes whether that step will save us or destroy us.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Which books do you like to read over and over again?</p> <p><strong>KM: </strong>George Orwell&#x2019;s <em>1984</em> for its incredibly dark take on human nature. Rian Malan&#x2019;s <em>My Traitor&#x2019;s Heart</em>, a book about Apartheid-era South Africa that has a more hopeful view of our species.

An icy evening in December 1940 saw the first meeting of two extraordinary spiritual leaders. Father Ed said that the graces he received from meeting Bill Wilson were as great as those he had received from his ordination as a priest, and Bill in turn described encountering the Jesuit as being like a second conversion experience, where he could feel the transcendent presence of God filling the entire room with grace. The good priest taught Wilson about St. Ignatius Loyola&#39;s Spiritual Exercises, about the eternal battle between good and evil which the Spanish saint described in that book, and explained the Jesuit understanding of the way we can use our deepest emotions to receive guidance from God while serving on that battlefield. The co-founder of the twelve step movement in turn supplied Father Ed with some of the most valuable tools he possessed for carrying out small group therapy on a wide range of different kinds of troubled people. Together the two men discussed Poulain&#39;s Graces of Interior Prayer and Bill&#39;s attempts to make spiritual contact with both spooks and saints, and explored the world of Lsd experiences and the teachings of the Catholic, Hindu, and Buddhist mystics in Aldous Huxley&#39;s Perennial Philosophy.

Away from her parents and expectations, she felt liberated, throwing herself into Manhattan life replete with a high-paying job, a gorgeous apartment, and a string of successful boyfriends. But the cutthroat world of finance and relentless pursuit of more began to take its toll. This wasn&#x2019;t the life she wanted, either. <br> &nbsp;<br> On the move again, Emma settles in the picturesque waterfront town of Westport, Connecticut, a world apart from both England and Manhattan. It is here that she begins to confront what it is she really wants from her life. With no job, and knowing only one person in town, she channels her passion for creating beautiful spaces into remaking the dilapidated cottage she rents from Dominic, a local handyman who lives next door with his six-year-old son. <br> &nbsp;<br> Unlike any man Emma has ever known, Dominic is confident, grounded, and committed to being present for his son, whose mother fled shortly after he was born. They become friends, and slowly much more, as Emma finds herself feeling at home in a way she never has before.<br> &nbsp;<br> But just as they start to imagine a life together as a family, fate intervenes in the most shocking of ways. For the first time, Emma has to stay and fight for what she loves, for the truth she has discovered about herself, or risk losing it all. <br> &nbsp;<br> In a novel of changing seasons, shifting lives, and selfless love, a story unfolds&#x2014;of one woman&#x2019;s far-reaching journey to discover who she is truly meant to be...<br><br><b>READERS GUIDE INCLUDED</b></p><p>A former journalist in the U.K. and a graduate of the International Culinary Center in New York, <b>Jane Green </b>has written many novels (including <i>Jemima J</i>, <i>The Beach House</i>, and, most recently, <i>Falling</i>), most of which have been <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers, and one cookbook, <i>Good Taste</i>.

As she looks down, her gaze lands on well-worn salmon-pink shag carpeting and quickly conceals her horror.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Emma wonders if this house might not even be beyond her capabil- ities to transform. Perhaps the landlord would let her paint it? Surely he would let her paint it&#x2014;who wouldn&#x2019;t want to lighten up this room, so dark it feels more like a cave? She would paint it for free, <i>and </i>pull up that carpet. Maybe &nbsp;she would be lucky and find a hardwood floor underneath; even if it was merely concrete, surely it wouldn&#x2019;t cost any- thing to stick down some inexpensive sisal.</p><p>This room could be transformed, she determined. Lipstick on a pig was her specialty.</p><p>Her landlord, or potential landlord, smiles. &#x201c;Hey, I know it&#x2019;s not everyone&#x2019;s taste today,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Why do people want everything to be gray and modern?&#x201d;</p><p>Emma is surprised by his comment, surprised frankly by his interest in making small talk. &#x201c;I hate that look,&#x201d; Emma offers. It happens that she does agree, quite passionately, in fact. &#x201c;None of those decorated houses feel like real homes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly!&#x201d;&nbsp;he says in delight. &#x201c;This is a home.&#x201d;</p><p>Struck by his words, by the obvious sincerity with which they are spoken, she turns to look at her potential landlord for the first time. She can&#x2019;t help but feel struck by the sight of him. He is not tall, only a couple</p><p></p><br><p></p><p><b>J A N E&nbsp; &nbsp;G R E E N </b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>of inches taller than her, with skin tanned by the sun and an easy smile that seems to put her at ease. It isn&#x2019;t so much that she finds him attractive, but that there is something familiar about him, a recognition, &nbsp;a sense of having somehow met him before.</p><p>Perhaps because she has remained silent, he goes on to add, &#x201c;At least, it was a home. My grandparents lived here for forty years.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Yes</i>, thinks Emma, <i>it looks like it. It smells like it, too. </i>The air is fusty. Of course old people had lived here. That explains the wood paneling and the floral wallpaper in the family room; it also explains the salmon- pink carpet and avocado-green bathroom suite with matching tile.</p><p>&#x201c;How would you feel about me putting . . .&#x201d; Emma pauses, wonder- ing how to say this diplomatically. She doesn&#x2019;t want to jump in and tell him she&#x2019;d like to tear everything out and start again. He probably doesn&#x2019;t want to change anything; his voice had softened when he men- tioned his grandparents. She has an odd reluctance to offend him, and she senses she&#x2019;ll need to take this slowly if she wants this house. &#x201c;. . . a woman&#x2019;s touch on the house?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A woman&#x2019;s touch!&#x201d; The landlord smiles and nods approvingly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what I&#x2019;ve been saying this house needs for years. A wom- an&#x2019;s touch.&#x201d;</p><p>She follows him into the kitchen at the back of the house and her heart sinks slightly. It hasn&#x2019;t been touched since the fifties, rough wood cabinets bumpy with layers of white paint, although pretty black iron hardware. Formica countertops with large cracks, and linoleum floors. A stove that is so ancient as to be fashionable again, and, surprisingly, a large modern &nbsp;stainless-steel fridge.</p><p>Emma looks at the fridge and raises an eyebrow as she looks over at the landlord.</p><p>Damn, she thinks. What was his name again? Donald? Derek? Something like that.</p><p>&#x201c;The old fridge gave up last year,&#x201d; he explains. &#x201c;The tenants picked out this one. And I paid for it,&#x201d; he adds quickly, as if to reassure her that he is a good landlord, on top of everything, ready to jump in and deal</p><p>with problems.</p><p>&#x201c;Great,&#x201d; says Emma, wandering over to the back door and peering out through the glass onto a fenced-in garden, or what could be a garden if the weeds were cleared. &#x201c;Can I go outside?&#x201d; she asks, already out the door.</p><p></p><br><p></p><p><b>FA L L I N G</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He follows her out, apologizing for the weeds. They both stand there as Emma looks around, her imagination already firing. There are two filthy peeling rattan chairs stacked off to the side, surrounded by boxes and baskets: in other words, trash.</p><p>The landlord turns to look and immediately apologizes. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been out here,&#x201d; he explains. &#x201c;Obviously all of that will be gone. I can replace those chairs with new ones.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma is again struck by him. His eagerness to please doesn&#x2019;t seem solely mercenary. He wants her to know that he cares about the house and yard. &#x201c;Do I get to choose what kinds of chairs the new ones are? Like the fridge?&#x201d; Emma says.</p><p>&#x201c;As long as they&#x2019;re not too expensive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am the expert at renovating on a shoestring.&#x201d; She smiles.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re my kind of woman.&#x201d; He laughs, as Emma flushes slightly and turns away. A flirtatious landlord is the last thing she wants right now. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; He apologizes immediately, realizing his mistake. &#x201c;I was kidding. But I&#x2019;m happy for you to choose things as long as they&#x2019;re within the budget.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma looks up at the sky, noting the sun, looking at the shadows to try and figure out which way the garden faces. &#x201c;Southwest,&#x201d; she guesses, and he turns to her with a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re&nbsp;a sun worshipper?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With this pale English skin?&#x201d; She laughs and shakes her head. &#x201c;I turn into one giant freckle in the sun. But I am a gardener. At least, a frustrated one. For years and years, I lived in flats in London dreaming of having a garden of my own. Then for the last five years I&#x2019;ve been on the top of a high-rise in Battery Park.&#x201d; Good lord. Why is she suddenly giving him her life story?</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, so you&#x2019;re a city girl.&#x201d; &#x201c;Not by choice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re&nbsp;ready to be out here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ready to be steps from the beach, in a gorgeous town where the pace of life is relaxed and the pressure is off? No. Definitely not.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve&nbsp;lived here my whole life, and wouldn&#x2019;t move any-</p><p>where else. How did you find Westport?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have a friend who lives here, who I used to work with. She moved out three years ago after she had a baby, and she loves it. I&#x2019;ve been out</p><p></p><br><p></p><p><b>J A N E&nbsp; &nbsp;G R E E N </b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>to visit her quite a few times, and something about this place feels right. I never thought I&#x2019;d be able to move out here permanently, but . . . I needed to make some big changes in my life. Moving somewhere like this, with a quieter pace of life, seemed like a good first step.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I saw on your application you&#x2019;re a banker. That&#x2019;s quite a commute.&#x201d; &#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; Emma says. &#x201c;I took a package. I&#x2019;m now officially unem- ployed, albeit with a very nice &nbsp;severance. I hope that won&#x2019;t &nbsp;be a</p><p>problem?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As long as you pay your rent, nothing&#x2019;s a problem. What are you going to do here in town?&#x201d;</p><p>Emma is struck again by the sincerity of his interest. He is not just making small talk, she is sure of it. He&#x2019;s looking at her, making her feel like he cares about what she&#x2019;ll say next. She shakes her head. &#x201c;Thank- fully, I have enough to have a little bit of breathing space. I don&#x2019;t really know. I&#x2019;ve always had a dream about doing something with the home. Interior design, gardening, that sort of thing. I&#x2019;ve been doing an online course to get the official qualification. Now all I need are clients.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And a house to do up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And a garden to transform. Preferably one that faces southwest.&#x201d; She grins as she looks around the garden.</p><p>He grins, too. &#x201c;Then you&#x2019;ve found it. It seems that you and this house were meant to be. Although, you couldn&#x2019;t do anything major to it without consulting with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Emma laughs politely. She couldn&#x2019;t move in <i>unless </i>she did something major with the house. As it is, it&#x2019;s completely awful, but stepping back to take it in, even with all its flaws, she thinks she could turn this into a charming beach cottage.</p><p>The landlord seems like a nice guy. He may be resistant to her changes at first, but she surmised that she could ask forgiveness rather than permission for most things. If he walked into this room and found the wood painted a lovely chalky white, the floors covered with sisal, the single lightbulb replaced with a pretty glass pendant light, surely he would be thrilled. Who <i>wouldn&#x2019;t </i>be thrilled at someone transforming</p><p>their house for nothing? He would undoubtedly get more money for it next time he decides to rent it out.</p><p>The truth is&nbsp;that&nbsp;Emma Montague isn&#x2019;t looking for somewhere perma-</p><p>nent just yet. She&#x2019;s&nbsp;just looking for a place to call home for the next year</p><p></p><br><p></p><p><b>FA L L I N G</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>or so. A year to try to recover from the last five years of working in finance in New York. A year to try to figure out what kind of life she wants to live. For five years she has lived a life that wasn&#x2019;t hers. Five years of utter exhaus- tion; five years of keeping her head down and working like the devil, putting away enough money to be able to afford to do what she is doing now, leaving the rat race and pursuing her dream. Her goal is to figure out what her dream is. Right now she only knows that the beginning step is to find a world and a life that feels likes her own; a life in which she finally feels she belongs.</p><p>It starts with a house. She is itching to buy, but it is more sensible to rent, making sure this is where she wants to live. Still, the rentals down by the beach, here in Westport, Connecticut, are mostly prohibitive for a single girl with a budget, even an ex-banker. The last thing she wants to do is blow all her savings on rent.</p><p>This house, this dated, fusty house, is entirely within her budget, precisely because it <i>is </i>so dated and fusty. It is the perfect size&#x2014;two bedrooms with a living room, kitchen, and family room that would make a perfect office.</p><p>And best of all there is a garden, or rather more than enough space for one. She can finally plant vegetables. She can put a gravel path down the middle, can grow tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce, plant roses and clematis over the fence at the back. She imagines a long, rustic table, a small group of friends sitting around, bottles of ros� and candles inter- spersed with galvanized &nbsp;steel pots of lavender running down the center. Laughter. Happy faces. Everyone lit by the glow of summer and love.</p><p>Emma shakes her head to bring herself back to earth. She knows only one person&#x2014;her friend Sophie Munster&#x2014;here in Westport. She has no other local friends she can invite to sit around the table, and since she&#x2019;s something of an introvert, it may take a little while to find them. But she will find them.</p><p>Although a bit of a loner, she is loyal, and fun, when she finds people with whom she is comfortable. She is thinking of taking up yoga, and maybe knitting. There are evening classes at the local yarn store, Sophie</p><p>says. They should both go. Sophie grew up here, although she went away to boarding school. She has friends from grade school, though, seems to know almost everyone in town. Surely it&#x2019;s only a matter of time before Emma&#x2019;s fantasy of summer evenings comes true.</p><p></p><br><p></p><p><b>J A N E&nbsp; &nbsp;G R E E N </b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>For as long as she can remember, Emma Montague has had a fascina- tion with America. Growing up in her upper-crust family in Somerset, England, sent off to boarding school, then moving to London after university to enter the world of banking, she had the persistent belief that this was not supposed to be her life.</i></p><p>As a little girl, she had never quite felt she fitted in. She was loved and treasured, but her boisterous, overbearing mother and loving but somewhat beleaguered and introverted father didn&#x2019;t quite know how to connect with their quiet, studious child. The place she felt happiest, the place she found her solace and joy, was in the pages of books.</p><p>She read all the time. It was so much easier than dealing with the chaos of her playmates during recess. She was close to one or two of her classmates, but she only liked seeing them one at a time. Otherwise, she was happier with her books. She was the child with the flashlight under the duvet late into every night. She would breeze through a book in a day and a half, then read it six more times.</p><p>She fell in love with America through the pages of these books. Her dull, patrician life in Gloucestershire felt very staid compared to the lives of Jo and her sisters in <i>Little Women</i>, and Katy in the What Katy Did series. &nbsp;She devoured &nbsp;the stories of Laura Ingalls &nbsp;Wilder and dreamed of having a farm out in the middle of nowhere, growing all her own vegetables, raising her own animals.</p><p>Life then got in the way, sweeping her up into the cutthroat world of London finance, not because she had a passion for finance, but because it was what all the girls were doing at that time. First London, then New York. Finally, now that she has extricated herself, it looks like she has a shot at the kind of life she might actually want to live.</p><p>Westport, Connecticut, may not be Walton&#x2019;s Mountain, but there are enough &nbsp;trees for her to pretend, and the beauty of the beach on the doorstep is something she now realizes she has always wanted.</p><p>When she was living in Manhattan she would go running along the river every morning before work. The sunlight glinting off the water</p><p>brought a calm and peace to every morning. She hadn&#x2019;t known how much she wanted to be by the water until Sophie drove her to Compo Beach for a walk one weekend. That was the moment she knew this was where she wanted to be.</p><p></p><br><p></p><p><b>FA L L I N G</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There had been a tremendous expectation for the life Emma was supposed to have led, at least from her parents. And she had tried to fit into the life they had designed for her. Namely, to work at a pretend job for a few years to enable her to meet the right kind of husband, before quickly getting pregnant, giving up work, and going on to raise three or four beautiful children in a lovely stone manse in Gloucestershire. Preferably near her parents. Have a couple of dogs, Gordon setters or pointers, possibly golden retrievers; have lots of local women friends who come for coffee. Get involved in the village fair and perhaps, given her love of books, institute a reading mentoring program in the less well-off town twenty minutes away.</p><p>Emma knew the path well, as it was the path so many of her child- hood friends had taken. At thirty-seven, she is the only one still unmar- ried, apart from Imogen Cutliffe, who is one of the leading lights of British screen and stage and about to star as the lead in a film starring Bradley Cooper. Emma is the only one who continued to work and rise up the corporate ladder, putting all her focus on making money. It wasn&#x2019;t that she cared about money for the sake of money, but that it was the only path out: making enough money to retire from banking in her thirties, and the freedom to pursue her dream.

A few weeks later a mathematician in Warsaw begins to decipher the coded communications of the Third Reich and lay the foundations for the code-breaking operation at Bletchley Park. The co-operation between France, Britain and Poland is given the cover name &#x2018;X, Y &amp; Z&#x2019;. December, 1942: It is the middle of World War II. The Polish code-breakers are in France on the run from the Gestapo. People who know the Enigma secret are not supposed to be in the combat zone for fear of capture so MI6 devises a plan to exfiltrate them. If it goes wrong, if they are caught, they could give away the greatest secret of the war. X, Y &amp; Z describes how French, British and Polish secret services came together to unravel the Enigma machine. It tells of how, under the very noses of the Germans, Enigma code-breaking continued in Vichy France. And how code-breakers from Poland continued their work for Her Majesty&#x2019;s Secret Service, watching the USSR&#x2019;s first steps of the Cold War. The people of X, Y and Z were eccentric, colorful and caught up in world events that they could watch not control.

He says that Buddha's concept of the root of suffering is misunderstood. It is not desire that causes suffering; desire is the fire that springs from the basic life force. Drawing upon the science of attachment theory, Amodeo illuminates how the root of our suffering is disconnection from ourselves and others, which is fueled by clinging to what doesn't serve us</p><p>In a conversational tone, Amodeo presents relationship as sacred experience. He teaches how to welcome desire mindfully rather than suppress it and how to overcome fear of failure in relating. He also discusses meditation as self-intimacy and holding ourselves with loving-kindness. Lastly, he explores the role of community in spiritual awakening and the issue of whom to trust--our guru or ourselves?<br></p></p><p><b>John Amodeo, PhD</b>, a licensed marriage and family therapist for over 30 years, has been engaged in Buddhism and spiritual practice for 40 years.

He has been interviewed or written articles for publications that include the Chicago Tribune, The Dallas Morning News and The Rocky Mountain News. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area."John Amodeo combines a lifetime of professional psychotherapist work, a love of mindful meditation, and a wry sense of humor ("vertical spirituality!") in his latest book, <i>Dancing with Fire</i>. Amodeo skillfully boils down the conflicting messages of Buddhism ("attachment" causes suffering) and modern psychology/spiritual self-help (love/partnerships equals depth of human experience) to give readers his view of what it means to live in this world: How to end or, at least, become more aware of the need to cling to "suffering." He applies this message to relationships, addressing issues of love, attachment, longing, intimacy, connection, and romance. <i>Dancing with Fire</i> is well written, down to earth, and very informative. It's an excellent guide for couples especially, but also for anyone searching to merge the detached mindfulness of Buddhism with loving spirituality into their modern, practical lives without compromising their feelings." --<b>Allyson Gracie</b>, <i>Retailing Insight</i>, June 2013<br><br>"<i>Dancing with Fire</i> by John Amodeo offers fresh takes on attachment, desire, longing, love, intimacy and spiritual meaning in relationships". -<b>-Frederic Brussat</b>, <i>Spirituality &amp; Practice</i><br><br>"<i>DANCING WITH FIRE</i> was an interesting read. It was about looking at past behaviors, explaining why we react to certain situations the way we do, and how to move forward. Recognizing the why was really important to me. I found myself reading certain sections and saying "hey that is me". It also explains the difference between "religion" and "spirituality", "flight and fight response", etc. A lot of the information was based on Buddism and for me, this was distracting at times because I am not familiar with Buddism. Because of this, I found myself putting the book down frequently. Having said that, I did find it informative and I did learn how to recognize my behaviors." --<i>MyBookAddictionReviews</i><br><br>"<i>Dancing With Fire</i> is wise, integrated, life affirming, and practical.

He died in July 2006.1 <br> &nbsp;<br> THE RIDER PAUSED at the crest of the pass, the wind swirling about him and screeching through the mountaintops. Far below him the lands of the Gabala stretched green and verdant, ribbon streams and shimmering rivers, hills and vales, forests and woods&#x2014;all as he remembered, echoing his dreams, calling for his return.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Home, Kuan,&#x2019; he whispered, but his words were whipped away by the wind, and the tall gray stallion did not hear him. Touching his heels to the horse&#x2019;s side, the rider leaned back in the saddle as his mount began the long descent. The wind dropped as they neared the deserted border fort, its gates of oak and bronze hanging on broken hinges. The Gabala eagle had been hacked from them&#x2014;only the edge of a wingtip was left on the rotting wood, and this was covered by a brown and green patina that all but merged it with the timber.<br> &nbsp;<br> The rider dismounted here. He was a tall man wearing a long hooded cloak, a heavy scarf wound about his face and holding the hood in place. He led the stallion into the derelict fort and halted before the statue of Manannan. The left arm was broken and lying on the cobbles. Someone had taken an ax or a hammer to the face, and the chin was smashed, the nose split.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;How soon they forget,&#x2019; said the newcomer. Hearing his voice, the stallion moved forward, nuzzling at his back. He turned, removed his thick woolen gloves, and stroked the beast&#x2019;s neck. It was warmer here, and he unwound the scarf, draping it over the pommel of his saddle. As he pushed back the hood, sunlight flashed from the silver helm he wore.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let us find you a drink, Kuan,&#x2019; he said, moving to the walled well at the center of the courtyard. The bucket was warped by the sun, gaping cracks showing beneath the iron rings. The rope was tinder-dry but still usable if handled with care. He searched the deserted outbuildings and returned with a clay jug and a deep plate, then stood the jug in the bucket before lowering both into the well. When he carefully drew the bucket up, water was gushing from the cracks, but the jug was full and he lifted it clear and drank deeply. Placing the plate on the cobbles, he filled it. The stallion dropped its head and drank. The rider loosened the saddle girth and poured more water into the plate, then climbed the rampart steps and sat in the sunshine.<br> &nbsp;<br> This was the end of empire, he knew. Not the blood-drenched battlegrounds, the screaming hordes, the discordant clash of steel on steel. Just the dust blowing across the cobbles, limbless statues, warped buckets, and the silence of the grave.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You would have hated this, Samildanach,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;This would have broken your heart.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> He searched inside himself for any grief over the fall of the Gabala. But there was no room&nbsp;...&nbsp;all his grief was for himself as he gazed down at his statue.<br> &nbsp;<br> Manannan, knight of the Gabala. One of the nine. Greater than princes, more than men. He delved into his hip pouch, pulling clear a silvered mirror, which he held up before his face.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Once-Knight looked into his own deep blue eyes, then at the square face and the silver steel that surrounded it. The plume was gone from the helm, hacked away in some skirmish to the north; the visor, raised now, dented by an ax blade in the Fomorian War. The runic number that named him had been torn from the brow in a battle to the east. He could not remember the blow; it was one of so many he had endured during the six lonely years since the gate had closed. His gaze shifted to the plate rings that circled his throat and pictured the beard growing beneath them, slowly&#x2014;oh, so slowly&#x2014;preparing to choke him to death.<br> &nbsp;<br> What a death for a Gabala knight, imprisoned within his helm, strangled by his own beard. Such was the price of betrayal, Manannan told himself. Such was the penalty for cowardice.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cowardice? He rolled the word in his mind. During the last lonely, aimless years of wandering he had proved his physical courage time and time again in swordplay, in the charge, in the long wait before the onslaught. But it was not his body that had let him down on that dark night six years before, when the black gate yawned and the stars died. It was altogether a different cowardice that had robbed him of the power to move.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not so the others. But then, Samildanach would have braved the fires of hell with a handful of snow. As would the others: Pateus, Edrin&nbsp;...&nbsp;all of them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Damn you, Ollathair,&#x2019; hissed the Once-Knight. &#x2018;Damn your arrogance!&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Manannan returned his mirror to its pouch.<br> &nbsp;<br> He rested for another hour and then stepped into the saddle. The citadel was three days ride west. He avoided towns and settlements, buying his food at isolated farms and sleeping in meadows. On the morning of the fourth day he approached the citadel.<br> &nbsp;<br> Manannan steered his stallion through the trees and into what had once been the rose garden. It was overgrown now, but here and there a bloom still flourished, stretching above the choking weeds. The paved path was mostly covered by grass and small blue flowers. It was only natural, thought the Once-Knight&#x2014;six years of windblown soil settling over the carefully laid stones. The side gate was open, and he rode into the courtyard. Here and there grass seeds had settled in the cracks of the pavement, fed by the fountain pool that overflowed its marble parapet.<br> &nbsp;<br> He dismounted, his silver armor creaking and his movements slow. The stallion stood motionless.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Not as you remember it, Kuan,&#x2019; whispered the knight, removing his gauntlet and stroking the beast&#x2019;s neck. &#x2018;They have all gone.&#x2019; He led the horse to the pool and waited as it drank. A wooden shutter nearby was caught by the wind, which cracked it against the window frame. The horse&#x2019;s head came up, ears laid flat against its skull.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;It&#x2019;s all right, boy,&#x2019; Manannan soothed. &#x2018;There is no danger here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As the stallion drank, he loosened the saddle girth and lifted the pack from its back. Hoisting this to his shoulder, he walked up the steps to the double doors and entered the welcome hall. Dust had gathered here, and the long carpet smelled of mildew and corruption. The statues stood staring at him with sightless eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> He felt the burden of his guilt grow even stronger and pushed on past the figures to the chapel at the rear of the building. The hinges groaned as he forced open the leaf-shaped door. No dust disturbed this place, with its low altar, but the golden candlesticks were gone, as were the silver chalice and the silken hangings. Yet still the chapel emanated peace. He lowered his pack and unfastened the leather binding thongs. Then he moved to the altar, removed his baldric and scabbard, and unbuckled his breastplate, slipping it under the protruding shoulder plates. Carefully he placed the armor on the altar. Shoulder plates and habergeon followed. He would miss the sleeveless coat of mail; it had saved his life more than once. Hip shields, thigh guards, and greaves he laid upon the stone, placing his black and silver gauntlets atop the breastplate.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let it be over,&#x2019; he said, reaching up to release the helm, but his fingers froze as fear flowed in him. The spell had been cast by Ollathair in this room six years before&#x2014;but without the wizard, was the peace of the chapel enough to remove it? Manannan calmed himself. His finger touched the spring lock, but the bar did not move. He pressed harder, then dropped his hand. Fear fled from the onset of his anger: &#x2018;What more do you want of me?&#x2019; he screamed. Sinking to his knees, he prayed for deliverance, but although his thoughts streamed out, there was no sense of their reaching a destination. Exhausted, he rose, a knight without armor. Moving to his pack, he dressed swiftly in well-fitting woolen trews and leather tunic, then looped his baldric over his shoulder with the sword and scabbard nestling at his right side. Finally he pulled on a pair of soft doeskin riding boots and gathered his blanket. The pack he left where it lay.<br> &nbsp;<br> Outside, the stallion was cropping grass at the far wall. The man who had been a knight walked past the beast and on to the smithy. It, too, was dust-covered, the tools rusted and useless, the great bellows torn and tattered, the forge open&#x2014;a nesting place for rats.<br> &nbsp;<br> Manannan picked up a rusted saw blade. Even had it been gleaming and new, it would have been useless to him. The silver steel of the helm was strong enough in its own right, but with the added power of Ollathair&#x2019;s enchantment it was impervious to everything but heat. He had once endured two hours of agony as a smith had sought to burn the bar loose. At last, defeated, the Craftsman had knelt before him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I could do it, sir, but there would be no point. The heat needed would turn your flesh to liquid, your brain to steam. You need a sorcerer, not a smith.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> And he had found sorcerers and would-be wizards, seers and Wyccha women. But none could counter the spell of the Armorer.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I need you, Ollathair,&#x2019; said the Once-Knight. &#x2018;I need your wizardry and your skills. But where did you go?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ollathair had been above all a patriot. He would not have left the realm unless forced. And who could force the Armorer of the Gabala knights? Manannan sat silently among the rusted remains of Ollathair&#x2019;s equipment and fought to remember conversations of long ago.<br> Considering the size of the empire it had once ruled, the lands of the Gabala were not large. From the borders of Fomoria in the south to the coastal routes to Cithaeron was a journey of less than a thousand miles. East to west, from the Nomad steppes to the western sea and Asripur, was a mere four hundred. One fact was sure: Ollathair would avoid cities; he had always hated the marble monstrosity of Furbolg.<br> &nbsp;<br> Where, then? And under what guise?<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Mediterranean Family Table: 125 Simple, Everyday Recipes Made with the Most Delicious and Healthiest Food on Earth</h2><p><p><strong><em>Tutti a tavola</em></strong>&#x2014;<strong>All to the table with this bounty of Mediterranean recipes to try, savor, and gather around</strong></p><p>To help his patients improve their health, Dr. Angelo Acquista began &#x201c;prescribing&#x201d; them recipes for nutritious and flavorful home-cooked meals prepared with ingredients key to the Mediterranean diet. <em>The Mediterranean Family Table </em>combines his medical experience and Sicilian roots to outline the guiding principles of the Mediterranean diet and takes it one step further with a collection of easy, wholesome, and delicious recipes the entire family will love.</p><p>From purees made with fresh vegetables that will tempt the taste buds of <em>bambini</em>&#x2014;and can serve as easy sides for the rest of the family&#x2014;to recipes tailored to meet the special nutritional needs of children and seniors (highlighted by icons for easy reference), this well-curated collection of recipes will allow you to:</p><p><strong>� Reinvent classic recipes </strong>by replacing mayonnaise and butter with heart-healthy olive oil in dishes like Mediterranean Potato Salad and Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes</p><p>� <strong>Discover good-for-you Mediterranean greens </strong>in kid-approved recipes like Orecchiette with Bread Crumbs and Broccoli Rabe, and Swiss Chard and Cannellini Beans alla Alessandra</p><p><strong>� Create your own &#x201c;Sunday Supper&#x201d; family tradition </strong>with recipes like Quick and Easy Tomato Sauce and Mama&#x2019;s Meatballs with Pasta</p><p><em>The Mediterranean Family Table </em>contains a wealth of helpful information, including how to make healthier eating choices; instill good habits in kids that will last a lifetime; and buy, store, and cook ingredients fundamental to the Mediterranean diet.

You will meet, for example, in "In the Dead of Truffle Season," a truffle-hunting pig who tries to whet his own appetite for a while; or Jumbo in "Chorus Girl's Absolutely Final Performance," a lonely, old circus elephant who decides she's had enough of show business and cruel trainers for one lifetime. In this satirical reprise of Kafka, cats, dogs, and breeding rodents are no longer ordinary beings in the happy home, but actually have the power to destroy the world in which we live.</p></p><p>Patricia Highsmith (1921&#x2013;1995) was the author of more than twenty novels, including Strangers on a Train, The Price of Salt,&nbsp;The Blunderer and The Talented Mr. Ripley, as well as numerous short stories.Grisly and atmospheric, these are perfectly nasty little tales told by an acknowledged mistress of the form ( Little Tales of Mysogyny. Whether it's Eddie, the Capuchin monkey, annoyed at the petty thief who employs him, or Djemal, the camel, getting back at a cruel driver, Highsmith's creatures are intelligent, vengeful and bloodthirsty. Even the aged Baron, a pampered and sophisticated city dog with worn-down teeth, finds a way of settling the score with the human he dislikes. Tales are told of a truffle-hunting pig, a ferret, a goat who gives rides in an amusement park, a sleek Siamese cat, chickens raised on an automated farm and an extended family of hamstersall sympathetically, but never sentimentally, portrayed. The stories feature small worlds of animal amorality in which the sweet taste of revenge leaves no aftertaste of guilt. It's a rich offering, best sampled in small bites. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Year in Paris: Season by Season in the City of Light</h2><p><p><strong>A <em>NEW YORK TIMES</em> "SUMMER READING" PICK!</strong></p><p><strong>From the incomparable John Baxter,&nbsp;award-winning author of the bestselling <em>The Most Beautiful Walk in the World</em>, a sumptuous and definitive portrait of Paris through the seasons, highlighting the unique tastes, sights, and changing personality of the city in spring, summer, fall, and winter.</strong></p><p>When the common people of France revolted in 1789, one of the first ways they chose to correct the excesses of the monarchy and the church was to rename the months of the year.

Ms. McCartney conveys the basics about many of these original colonists: their origins, the names of the ships they sailed on, the names of the "hundreds" and "plantations" they inhabited, the names of their spouses and children, their occupations and their position in the colony, their relationships with fellow colonists and Indian neighbors, their living conditions as far as can be ascertained from documentary sources, their ownership of land, the dates and circumstances of their death, and a host of fascinating, sometimes incidental details about their personal lives, all gathered together in the handy format of a biographical dictionary.<p></p><p>Maps provided here identify the sites at which Virginia's earliest plantations were located and enable genealogists and students of colonial history to link most of the more than 5,500 people included in this volume to the cultural landscape. An introductory chapter, moreover, includes an overview of local and regional settlement and provides succinct histories of the various plantations established in Tidewater Virginia by 1635.</p></p><p>Even the queen has been caught up in the celebration of the 400th anniversary of Jamestown. This exhaustively researched volume lists the original colonists as well as several thousand planters, merchants, glassmakers, haberdashers, laborers, mariners, maidservants, transported vagrants, and others who came after them, along with some of the Indians they encountered. For many there is little surviving documentation, and these are given just a line or two. For others there are more detailed histories. Also here are descriptions of various surrounding settlements and plantations. A useful glossary explains the meaning of recurring terms, like ancient planter. Indispensible for collections in the region and all comprehensive history collections.

In his introduction, Strauss says, &#x201c;Genesis is the book of commencement; Revelation is the book of consummation.&#x201d; The author identifies three distinct systems of interpretation of Revelation&#x2015;The Preterist School, The Presentist School, and The Prophetic School. Subscribing to the latter, Strauss holds that the largest part of the Book of Revelation is prophetic, and thus it applies to a period still future.</p><p>Lehman Strauss, Litt.D., F.R.G.S., taught Old Testament history for eight years at Philadelphia Bible Institute and served as pastor of the Calvary Baptist Church in Bristol, Pa., from 1939 to 1957.

At its height it involved nearly a million Chinese and Japanese soldiers, while sucking in three million civilians as unwilling spectators and, often, victims. It turned what had been a Japanese adventure in China into a general war between the two oldest and proudest civilizations of the Far East. Ultimately, it led to Pearl Harbor and to seven decades of tumultuous history in Asia. The Battle of Shanghai was a pivotal event that helped define and shape the modern world.<br><br>In its sheer scale, the struggle for China&#x2019;s largest city was a sinister forewarning of what was in store for the rest of mankind only a few years hence, in theaters around the world. It demonstrated how technology had given rise to new forms of warfare, or had made old forms even more lethal. Amphibious landings, tank assaults, aerial dogfights and most importantly, urban combat, all happened in Shanghai in 1937. It was a dress rehearsal for World War II&#x2014;or perhaps more correctly it was the inaugural act in the war&#x2014;the first major battle in the global conflict.<br><br>Actors from a variety of nations were present in Shanghai during the three fateful autumn months when the battle raged. The rich cast included China's ascetic Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his Japanese adversary, General Matsui Iwane, who wanted Asia to rise from disunity, but ultimately pushed the continent toward its deadliest conflict ever. Claire Chennault, later of &#x201c;Flying Tiger&#x201d; fame, was among the figures emerging in the course of the campaign, as was First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. In an ironic twist, Alexander von Falkenhausen, a stern German veteran of the Great War, abandoned his role as a mere advisor to the Chinese army and led it into battle against the Japanese invaders.<br><br>Written by Peter Harmsen, a foreign correspondent in East Asia for two decades, and former bureau chief in Taiwan for the French news agency AFP, Shanghai 1937 fills a gaping chasm in our understanding of the Second World War.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Acknowledgments<br>Prologue<br><br>1.

As Jews everywhere rejected the traditional laws of Judaism in favor of new norms established by Sabbetai Zevi, and abandoned reason for the ecstasy of messianic enthusiasm, one man watched in horror. <i>Dissident Rabbi</i> tells the story of Jacob Sasportas, the Sephardic rabbi who alone challenged Sabbetai Zevi's improbable claims and warned his fellow Jews that their Messiah was not the answer to their prayers.</p><p>Yaacob Dweck's absorbing and richly detailed biography brings to life the tumultuous century in which Sasportas lived, an age torn apart by war, migration, and famine. He describes the messianic frenzy that gripped the Jewish Diaspora, and Sasportas's attempts to make sense of a world that Sabbetai Zevi claimed was ending. As Jews danced in the streets, Sasportas compiled <i>The Fading Flower of the Zevi</i>, a meticulous and eloquent record of Sabbatianism as it happened. In 1666, barely a year after Sabbetai Zevi heralded the redemption, the Messiah converted to Islam at the behest of the Ottoman sultan, and Sasportas's book slipped into obscurity.</p><p><i>Dissident Rabbi</i> is the revelatory account of a spiritual leader who dared to articulate the value of rabbinic doubt in the face of messianic certainty, and a revealing examination of how his life and legacy were rediscovered and appropriated by later generations of Jewish thinkers.</p></p><p>A book about the life and times of Jacob Sasportas (1610&#x2013;98), a rabbi from North Africa who emerged as the primary opponent of the mass messianic Jewish movement that coalesced around Sabbatai Sevi in the 1660s.<b>Yaacob Dweck</b> is associate professor of history and Judaic studies at Princeton University.

H. Lawrence fashions one of the world&#x2019;s most original autobiographical novels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gertrude Morel is a refined woman who married beneath her and has come to loathe her brutal, working-class husband. She focuses her passion instead on her two sons, who return her love and despise their father. Trouble begins when Paul Morel, a budding artist, falls in love with a young woman who seems capable of rivaling his mother for possession of his soul. In the ensuing battle, he finds his path to adulthood tragically impeded by the enduring power of his mother&#x2019;s grasp. Published on the eve of World War I, SONS AND LOVERS confirmed Lawrence&#x2019;s genius and inaugurated the controversy over his explicit writing about sexuality and human relationships that would follow him to the end of his career.</p></p><p><i>Sons and Lovers</i> was the first modern portrayal of a phenomenon that later, thanks to Freud, became easily recognizable as the Oedipus complex. Never was a son more indentured to his mother's love and full of hatred for his father than Paul Morel, D.H. Lawrence's young protagonist. Never, that is, except perhaps Lawrence himself. In his 1913 novel he grappled with the discordant loves that haunted him all his life--for his spiritual childhood sweetheart, here called Miriam, and for his mother, whom he transformed into Mrs. Morel. It is, by Lawrence's own account, a book aimed at depicting this woman's grasp: "as her sons grow up she selects them as lovers--first the eldest, then the second. These sons are <i>urged</i> into life by their reciprocal love of their mother--urged on and on. But when they come to manhood, they can't love, because their mother is the strongest power in their lives." <p> Of course, Mrs. Morel takes neither of her two elder sons (the first of whom dies early, which further intensifies her grip on Paul) as a literal lover, but nonetheless her psychological snare is immense. She loathes Paul's Miriam from the start, understanding that the girl's deep love of her son will oust her: "She's not like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him. She wants to absorb him." Meanwhile, Paul plays his part with equal fervor, incapable of committing himself in either direction: "Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?... And why did he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he hated her--and he easily hated her." Soon thereafter he even confesses to his mother: "I really <i>don't</i> love her. I talk to her, but I want to come home to you."</p><p> The result of all this is that Paul throws Miriam over for a married suffragette, Clara Dawes, who fulfills the sexual component of his ascent to manhood but leaves him, as ever, without a complete relationship to challenge his love for his mother. As Paul voyages from the working-class mining world to the spheres of commerce and art (he has fair success as a painter), he accepts that his own achievements must be equally his mother's.

Nor does he shirk in his vivid, sensuous descriptions of the landscape that offers up its blossoms and beasts and "shimmeriness" to Paul's sensitive spirit. <i>Sons and Lovers</i> lays fully bare the souls of men and earth. Few books tell such whole, complicated truths about the permutations of love as resolutely without resolution. It's nothing short of searing to be brushed by humanity in this manner. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Now printed in full for the first time, Sons and Lovers is one of the great works of twentieth-century literature. In 1913, at the time of its first publication, Lawrence reluctantly agreed to the removal of no fewer than eighty passages which until now have never been restored.</p><h2>The There&#39;s That Beat!

In the middle of the interview she told her male Muslim interviewer that it was her turn to speak. And, she did. She told him to "shut up". This simple, yet radical, act of a Muslim woman asserting herself in the face of a Muslim man, catapulted her to fame. Now, for the first time, Wafa Sultan tells her story and airs her provocative views in a book that pulls no punches in looking clearly at Islam and the threat it poses for the rest of the world. Her viewpoint and opinions were hard won: As an intelligent young girl who would someday become a psychiatrist, she grew up in Syria under the thumb of a culture ruled by a god who hates women and all they represent. It is from this kernel of female hatred at the heart of Islam that Wafa Sultan builds her case against the mullahs and their followers bent on destroying the West. <i>A God Who Hates</i> is a fiery book that will remind readers why, even at a time when we are reaching out to others, we must be ever-vigilant about the threat Islam poses towards the West.</p></p><p><p>WAFA SULTAN is a Syrian-born American psychiatrist included on <i>Time Magazine's</i> list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2006. She created a firestorm on Al-Jazeera as the first Arab Muslim woman on that network who demanded to be heard.</p><p>&#x201c;An absorbing book, full of Dickensian details.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Forbes</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wafa Sultan is a great heroine of our times, willing to risk everything to stand up to these immense evils when most people are too fainthearted or politically correct to do so. A God Who Hates should be read closely and studied by the President, European leaders, and all Western policymakers and opinion-shapers -- before it is too late.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Robert Spencer, author of the New York Times bestsellers The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) and The Truth About Muhammad</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wafa Sultan experienced firsthand the immense contempt of human dignity Islam harbours, and the unimaginable cruelty Muslim women have to endure on a daily basis, resulting from it. Her compelling book is a touching life story filled with bone chilling examples of what it is like to live in a society that is ruled by Islam and how valuable our Western freedom truly is. It is because brave women like Wafa Sultan have the courage to speak out against this doctrine of hate that we in the West have been forewarned. I hope that everyone reads this book and takes note of the important message it contains. We must defend our precious liberties, our Western freedom and never give in to Islam.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Geert Wilders, member of the Dutch Parliament and leader of the Party for Freedom</i></p><p>&#x201c;With rare courage and candor, Wafa Sultan throws open the shuttered windows on Islam, letting clean, bright sunshine pour into its darkest corners to illuminate Islam from the inside. This is where she lived it, confronted it, and ultimately rejected its sacralized teachings--on women, on marriage, on children, on Christians, on Jews, on freedom of conscience, on war, on world domination--as a humanity-warping pathology based on hate and fear. Such is the fascinating psychological analysis that is the underpinning achievement of <i>A God Who Hates</i>: With unique insight and unstinting compassion, Wafa Sultan, a trained psychiatrist, employs her expertise to put Islam on the couch. The results of her analysis will startle, engage, deepen and transform every reader's understanding of Islam forever.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Diana West, author of The Death of the Grown-Up: How America's Arrested Development is Bringing Down Western Civilization</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wafa Sultan paints a scorching, unforgettable portrait of Syrian Muslim society, especially the degradation of its women, and lyrically appreciates her adopted American homeland, which she calls "the land of dreams." But she also worries that Middle East customs are encroaching on the West and writes with passion to awaken Americans to a menace they barely recognize, much less fear.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Daniel Pipes, Director, Middle East Forum</i></p><p>&#x201c;Like thousands of others, I first encountered Wafa Sultan on a stunning YouTube video. Here was a woman on Al-Jazeer a TV, eloquently and courageously defending Western civilization, individualism and reason against the barbarity and mysticism of radical Islam. Her performance was mesmerizing. She was articulate, self-confident, and outspoken. She stunned the audience, the interviewer and the pathetically out-matched Imam who opposed her. Now Wafa Sultan has written her life story in this powerful book. She exposes the ugliness that is Muslim society in theMiddle East, while unapologetically defending the Western values she adopted when rejecting the religion of Islam. If you want to understand this courageous woman, who continues to fight for her beliefs in spite of death threats, and to understand her views on the conflict between Islam and the West, this is a must read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Yaron Brook, Ph.D., President and Executive Director, The Ayn Rand Institute</i></p></p><h2>Judgment on Deltchev</h2><p>Foster&#x2019;s dramatic skill is well-known in London&#x2019;s West End theaters.

As I grabbed it and set it upright, I got a glimpse of the underside of the seat. There was a pair of sentences scratched into it. Or, more accurately, one and a half sentences. ONCE I WAS HUMAN BUT THEY HAVE TAKEN MY HUMANITY. ONCE I WAS ALIVE BUT THEY It ended there. That was all it said. My heart pounding, I gently set the stool upright. But as soon as my fingers had let go of the smooth, round edge, it knocked itself over...and started rolling toward me again. At first, I watched in silence, not really able to believe what my eyes were seeing. Then it bumped up against my foot. I scrambled backward, running into the bed. Something came loose behind me. When I turned, I saw what I had dislodged -- a leather strap, complete with buckles, bolted to the bed frame. When I lifted the bedspread, I found two more -- one for ankles, and a big one that would fit perfectly across a torso. Don&#39;t freak out, I told myself. Just go. Get your things and go. I grabbed my bookbag, double-checked to make sure I had my phone and charger, and started into the hall. The bathroom door gaped open, and I caught a flash of lightning through the window. I paused, wishing I&#39;d thought to bring a raincoat, when a high-pitched scream filled the air.

And while the reality of the devastation is undeniable, there is &nbsp;reason for hope in at least one small pocket of the nation: the cantons of Rojava in Syrian Kurdistan, where in the wake of war people are quietly building one of the most progressive societies in the world today.&nbsp;Revolution in Rojava&nbsp;tells the story of Rojava's groundbreaking experiment in what they call democratic confederalism, a communally organized democracy that is fiercely anti-capitalist and committed to female equality, while rejecting reactionary nationalist ideologies. Rooted in the ideas of imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, the system is built on effective gender quotas, bottom-up democratic structures, far-sighted ecological policies, and a powerful militancy that has allowed the region to keep ISIS at bay. This first full-length study of democratic developments in Rojava tells an extraordinary and powerfully hopeful story of a little-known battle for true freedom in dark times.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Michael Knapp</b>&nbsp;is a historian of radical democracy,&nbsp;<b>Ercan Aybo&#x11f;a</b>&nbsp;is an environmental engineer and activist, and <b>Anja Flach</b>&nbsp;is an enthologist and member of the Rojb�n women&#x2019;s council in Hamburg. <b>Janet Biehl</b> is a writer, editor, and translator.

The rich are getting richer by rigging the system in their favor, leaving the rest of us to struggle just to keep our heads above water. To save the American Dream, we&#x2019;re told that we need to fight inequality through tax hikes, wealth redistribution schemes, and a far higher minimum wage.</p><p>But what if that narrative is wrong? What if the real threat to the American Dream isn&#x2019;t rising income inequality&#x2015;but an all-out war on success?</p><p>In <i>Equal is Unfair, </i>a timely and thought-provoking work, Don Watkins and Yaron Brook reveal that almost everything we&#x2019;ve been taught about inequality is wrong. You&#x2019;ll discover:</p><p>� why successful CEOs make so much money&#x2015;and deserve to<br>� how the minimum wage hurts the very people it claims to help<br>� why middle-class stagnation is a myth<br>� how the little-known history of Sweden reveals the dangers of forced equality<br>� the disturbing philosophy behind Obama&#x2019;s economic agenda.</p><p>The critics of inequality are right about one thing: the American Dream is under attack. But instead of fighting to make America a place where anyone can achieve success, they are fighting to tear down those who already have. The real key to making America a freer, fairer, more prosperous nation is to protect and celebrate the pursuit of success&#x2015;not pull down the high fliers in the name of equality.</p></p><p><p><b>Don Watkins</b> is coauthor, with Yaron Brook, of the bestseller <i>Free Market Revolution. </i>A fellow at the Ayn Rand Institute and a former Forbes.com columnist, Watkins writes for <i>The Guardian, USA Today, </i>and FoxNews.com, among many others.

As Watkins and Brook show, reason and freedom, not handouts and high taxes, are the foundations of human progress. And production, not redistribution, is the source of human flourishing.&#x201d;--<b>John A. Allison, retired President and CEO of the, Cato Institute, and retired Chairman and CEO of BB&amp;T</b></p><p>&#x201c;There are basically two ways of thinking about policy responses to inequality&#x2015;raising or leveling. Leveling tends to promote the idea that there is a fixed pie of wealth in society and distribution is a function of luck, while raising tends to promote the idea that wealth must be created by individuals who realize the gains from trade and the gains from innovation, and as such distribution is a function of rewards for superior talent and insight into how to satisfy the demands of others in the market. Human excellence must be acknowledged before it can be rewarded, and talents are to be celebrated rather than explained away as a consequence of luck. In <i>Equal is Unfair</i>, Watkins and Brook provide a persuasive defense of human excellence, and of true capitalism which brings out the best in humanity and unleashes the creative genius in man in the arts, science and commerce.

To its contemporaries, the event was a journey and the men who took part in it pilgrims. Only later were those participants dubbed Crusaders&#x2014;"those signed with the Cross." In fact, many developments with regard to the First Crusade, like the bestowing of the cross and the elaboration of Crusaders' privileges, did not occur until the late twelfth century, almost one hundred years after the event itself.</p><p>In a greatly expanded second edition, Edward Peters brings together the primary texts that document eleventh-century reform ecclesiology, the appearance of new social groups and their attitudes, the institutional and literary evidence dealing with Holy War and pilgrimage, and, most important, the firsthand experiences by men who participated in the events of 1095-1099.</p><p>Peters supplements his previous work by including a considerable number of texts not available at the time of the original publication. The new material, which constitutes nearly one-third of the book, consists chiefly of materials from non-Christian sources, especially translations of documents written in Hebrew and Arabic.

Foucault&#x2019;s bow.&#x201d;</p><p>Jillian cocked a hip. &#x201c;Or you could just call it lopsided.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;O, ye of little faith.&#x201d; I abandoned my attempts at Martha Stewartry. The guests wouldn&#x2019;t care if there were bows or not. They just wanted us to be happy. And an open bar. &#x201c;You said there was a delivery? Please tell me it&#x2019;s the port-a-loos.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a perfectly good bathroom down the hall. If you want to, you know, wash off that thing.&#x201d; Jillian gestured at the tectonic layers of mud that were beginning to crack on my face.</p><p>No, I hadn&#x2019;t fallen in the garden. I had fallen prey to my oldest friend, Pammy, and her Big Box of Beauty Aids. Which appeared to involve highly priced purple-tinted garden mud.</p><p>&#x201c;Not for me. For the reception,&#x201d; I said patiently. Well, sort of patiently. My mud mask was beginning to itch.</p><p>I was pretty sure it wasn&#x2019;t supposed to itch.</p><p>&#x201c;Not unless it&#x2019;s one for midgets,&#x201d; said Jillian.</p><p>&#x201c;Cutlery? A tent?&#x201d; I followed Jillian down the hall, ticking off items, and rather wishing we&#x2019;d thought to invest in item number one: a wedding planner.</p><p>&#x2019;Twas the afternoon before my wedding, and all through Selwick Hall nothing was where it was supposed to be, not one thing at all. We had chosen to be married in Colin&#x2019;s not-so-stately home, on the theory that if you pour enough champagne, no one will notice the cracks in the plaster or the faded bits in the upholstery. We were having the ceremony in the drawing room and the reception on the grounds, which had sounded romantic in theory.</p><p>Like many things that sounded romantic in theory, it was proving more difficult in fact. Right now I was awaiting the delivery of a tent, several cartloads of china, folding chairs, half a dozen port-a-loos, and Colin&#x2019;s best man, who had inexplicably failed to arrive, although his explanation through the crackling cell phone connection had hinted at obstacles including pile-ups on the A23, an overturned lorry just out of London, and the sheeted dead rising and gibbering in the streets.</p><p>Translation: he&#x2019;d overslept and was just now leaving.</p><p>My future mother-in-law, on the other hand, had arrived safe and sound, which just went to show that there were times when the universe didn&#x2019;t have its priorities straight.</p><p>With twenty-four hours left to go, I was beginning to wonder whether I shouldn&#x2019;t have taken my mother&#x2019;s advice and just had the wedding in New York.</p><p>But it was Selwick Hall that had kind of, sort of brought us together. Or at least given us the opportunity to find each other, depending on how you preferred to look at it.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t come to England for love. I&#x2019;d crossed the pond in search of a spy. And if that makes me sound like an extra from a James Bond movie, it couldn&#x2019;t be further from the truth. The spy I was looking for was long since out of commission. My hunting grounds weren&#x2019;t grotty clubs or the glass-walled lair of a villain with a taste for seventies-style furnishings, but the archives of the British Library and the Public Records Office in Kew; my weapons, a few heavily underlined secondary sources and ARCHON, which might sound like the sort of acronym chosen by a criminal cartel, but was really the electronic search engine for manuscript sources in the UK. Plug in a name and&#x2014;voil�!&#x2014;it would locate that person&#x2019;s papers. Letters, diaries, random ramblings, you name it.</p><p>There was one slight problem: To find the papers, you needed a name. Spies tend not to use their real names. Unless they&#x2019;re Bond, James Bond. I&#x2019;d always wondered why, with such a public profile, no one had succeeded in bumping him off between missions.</p><p>The Pink Carnation hadn&#x2019;t made the same mistake. The spy who gave the French Ministry of Police headaches, who had caused Bonaparte to gnash his molars into early extraction, didn&#x2019;t go by his real name. He was everywhere and nowhere, a pastel shadow in the night. Oh, people had speculated about the Carnation&#x2019;s identity. Some argued that he wasn&#x2019;t even English, but a Frenchman, cunningly pretending to be an Englishman playing a Frenchman. And if that isn&#x2019;t enough to make you want to reach for a gin and tonic, I don&#x2019;t know what is.</p><p>But I had one lead. Sort of. When you&#x2019;re desperate, &#x201c;sort of&#x201d; starts looking pretty good. According to Carnation lore, the Carnation had his start in the League of the Purple Gentian, a spy unmasked fairly early in the game as one Lord Richard Selwick, younger son of the Marquess of Uppington.</p><p>So I&#x2019;d done what any desperate grad student would do: I&#x2019;d written to all the remaining descendants of Lord Richard Selwick, asking, pretty please, if anyone might happen to have any family papers lurking about in the attic or under a bed or tucked away among the lining of their sock drawers.</p><p>Did I mention that Colin just happened to be a descendant of that long-ago Lord Richard?</p><p>I found documents. I found love. I found the identity of the Pink Carnation. I didn&#x2019;t quite find my doctorate, but that was another story. It was all ribbons and roses and happily-ever-afters, or at least it would be as long as the caterers catered, my mother didn&#x2019;t kill my future mother-in-law before the ceremony, and all the bits and pieces made their way into place by roughly ten a.m. tomorrow.</p><p>I say ten a.m. because we were doing this the traditional way, morning suits and all. Everyone would be blotto by noon and hungover by sunset, but that seemed a small price to pay for the sight of Colin in a morning suit.</p><p>And yes, I may have watched <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i> one too many times.</p><p>&#x201c;Delivery?&#x201d; I reminded Jillian.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a box,&#x201d; said Jillian informatively. &#x201c;I signed for it for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did it clink?&#x201d; I asked plaintively. Booze. Booze would be good. Wedding guests would forgive lopsided bows and a missing best man as long as there was enough booze.</p><p>&#x201c;See for yourself.&#x201d; The deliverymen, in the way of deliverymen, had dropped the box smack in the middle of the hall, where it was currently impersonating a large speed bump.</p><p>Just what our wedding was missing: a do-it-yourself obstacle course.</p><p>Although, come to think of it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>I abandoned that tempting thought. Survival of the fittest is a principle best not applied to wedding guests. The person most likely to wipe out on the box was me, after a few gin and tonics too many at our rehearsal dinner.</p><p>I was not looking forward to the rehearsal dinner, that intimate occasion where one&#x2019;s nearest and dearest can shower blessings on the impending nuptials. The big problem was that Colin&#x2019;s nearest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let&#x2019;s just say they weren&#x2019;t always dearest. There was enough bad blood there to give a vampire indigestion.</p><p>It was tough enough for Colin that his mother had run off with a younger man, a man only a decade older than Colin. Worse that she had done so while his father was dying, slowly and painfully, of cancer. But the real kicker? The younger man was Colin&#x2019;s own cousin.</p><p>It got even more fun when you factored in Colin&#x2019;s sister joining with his mother and stepfather in a coup against Colin the previous year, when they&#x2019;d used the combined voting power of their shares in Selwick Hall to saddle Colin with a film company on the grounds of the Hall.</p><p>Never mind that Colin was the one who actually, you know, lived there.</p><p>For the most part, it had all been smoothed over. Colin and his sister were speaking again&#x2014;just. And Colin and his stepfather had reached a tentative peace. As for Colin and his mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that relationship made no more sense to me than it ever had.</p><p>The one saving grace in the mix&#x2014;other than my groom himself, of course&#x2014;was Colin&#x2019;s aunt, Arabella Selwick-Alderly. I wasn&#x2019;t sure whether it was her natural air of quiet dignity or the fact that she knew where all the bodies were buried, but either way, she was very effective at exerting a calming influence over feuding Selwicks.</p><p>I looked down at the box in the middle of the hall. It wasn&#x2019;t a box so much as a trunk, the old-fashioned kind with a domed lid and brass bands designed to hold it together through squall, shipwreck, and clumsy customs officials. It looked as though it had been sent direct from Sir Arthur Wellesley, from his headquarters in Lisbon.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s a wedding present?&#x201d; said Jillian dubiously.</p><p>I looked from Jillian to the trunk, a smile breaking across my face. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what it is.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Selwick-Alderly had already given us a wedding present, and a rather nice one: a Georgian tea set, made of the sort of silver that bent the wrist when you tried to lift it. But there was no one else this could be from.</p><p>Unless the Duke of Wellington really had sent his campaign trunk from beyond the grave.</p><p>Ignoring the flaking mud on my face, I knelt down before the trunk. The box looked like it had been through several wars. The boards were warped with age and the elements; the brass tacks were crooked in parts and missing in others. But it had held together. Rather like the Selwick family.</p><p>It was also quite firmly locked. Again like the Selwick family.</p><p>I sat back on my haunches. &#x201c;Was there a note? A key?&#x201d;</p><p>Jillian held up her hands, palms up. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look at me. I&#x2019;m just the messenger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eloise?&#x201d; I could hear the slap of my mother&#x2019;s Ferragamo pumps in the passage from the kitchen to the hall. Enter Mother, stage right, looking harried. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a circus tent going up in your backyard.&#x201d;</p><p>Poor Mom. She would have been much happier with a wedding at the Cosmopolitan Club, where all the arrangements simply happened, and no one had to figure out the placement of tents. My family has never gone in for camping. Or, for that matter, circuses.</p><p>I tried to sound reassuring. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the marquee, Mom. It&#x2019;s where we&#x2019;re having the reception.&#x201d;</p><p>My mother looked unconvinced. &#x201c;Are you sure they didn&#x2019;t rip off Ringling Brothers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think they have Ringling Brothers here.&#x201d;</p><p>My mother cast a dark glance over her shoulder. &#x201c;Not anymore, they don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Send in the clowns&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,&#x201d; sang Jillian, not quite sotto voce. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother. They&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;</p><p>I glowered at my sister over the domed lid of the Creepy Old Trunk. &#x201c;Funny. Don&#x2019;t you have a senior essay to write or something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not until next month.&#x201d; Jillian smiled beatifically at me. &#x201c;Until then, I&#x2019;m all yours.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lucky me,&#x201d; I said dourly. Which, of course, really translated to <i>I love you</i>. It was, as Jillian would say, the way we rolled. We snarked because we loved. &#x201c;Have I mentioned that I&#x2019;m really glad you&#x2019;re here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; said Jillian serenely. She gave me a one-armed hug that somehow managed to be equal parts comfort and condescension, as only a college senior knows how. &#x201c;Nervous?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine why.&#x201d; Drawing up a Selwick seating chart was like navigating a field full of land mines. And we all know how well that usually goes. Before the evening was over, someone was going to blow.</p><p>I just hoped it wouldn&#x2019;t be me.</p><p>&#x201c;Oy,&#x201d; said someone from the doorway. His voice was rather muffled by the large, rectangular object on a dolly in front of him. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you want this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not in the house,&#x201d; I said quickly. &#x201c;If you just take the path around the back to the garden, and make a right past the tent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show him,&#x201d; said my mother, with her best martyr look. &#x201c;You can go&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She gestured wordlessly at my face.</p><p>&#x201c;Make yourself look a little less like Barney?&#x201d; Jillian suggested.</p><p>&#x201c;You used to love Barney,&#x201d; said my mother reprovingly, and shooed the port-a-loo guys out the door.</p><p>&#x201c;I was three,&#x201d; said Jillian, to nobody in particular.</p><p>&#x201c;Yup. I&#x2019;m saving that for <i>your</i> wedding.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; said Jillian, with a look of deep speculation that did not bode well for tomorrow&#x2019;s maid-of-honor speech. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Colin?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Relative wrangling.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ll say this for the Selwicks: they&#x2019;d all come out of the woodwork for our wedding, flying in from the far corners of the Earth, or stumbling in from the pub down the road, depending. There was a large Canadian delegation, as well as a bunch fresh off the plane from the UAE; there were Posies and Pollys and Sallys and enough hyphenated last names to make writing out place cards an exercise in wrist strain. The Posies and Pollys and Sallys were all very well. The main concern was that Colin not be left alone with his mother or stepfather for more than five minutes. I couldn&#x2019;t even check in with him, since he&#x2019;d left his cell phone with me, in case the tent people or the caterers called. &#x201c;Oh, Lord. Would you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On it,&#x201d; said Jillian, and whisked out the door in search of her future brother-in-law. Pity the Selwick who got in her way.</p><p>There were all sorts of useful things I could be doing: tying bows on favors, chipping off my mud mask, promoting world peace, but instead I knelt beside the trunk.</p><p>The note was there, half stuck beneath the trunk, the creamy stationery grimed. I wrestled the envelope out from under the edge.</p><p><i>Eloise</i>, it said, in letters that had never seen a ballpoint pen. The handwriting was as elegant as ever, but, I noticed with a pang, less certain than I had seen it before. Mrs. Selwick-Alderly had seemed ageless when I first met her, but she wasn&#x2019;t ageless, any more than the rest of us, and the last two years had taken their toll.</p><p>With hands that weren&#x2019;t entirely steady, I slid the note from the envelope.</p><p><i>My dear Eloise,</i></p><p><i>As you have no doubt guessed, this trunk was once the property of Miss Jane Wooliston. It traveled with her from Shropshire to Paris, from Paris to Venice, and from Venice to Lisbon.</i></p><p>Miss Jane Wooliston. I lowered the note, looking at the trunk with something like awe. I had spent the past three years tracing the steps of the spy known as the Pink Carnation, following her from Shropshire to France, from France to Ireland, from Ireland to England. But in all of that, I had never encountered anything that had belonged directly to her.</p><p>This was her trunk. She had used it in her travels, packed it with her disguises. It might, I thought with rising excitement, hold secret compartments, letters, clothing, clues to the Carnation&#x2019;s personality.</p><p>And more than that. I had hit a wall in my research back in the fall.

He reveals 20-million-year-old quartzite tools discovered in the remains of extinct fauna in Argentina and other evidence of ancient pre-human cultures from which we are not descended. He traces the genesis of modern human civilization to Indonesia and the Central Pacific 75,000 years ago, launched by a catastrophic volcanic eruption that abruptly reduced humanity from two million to a few thousand individuals worldwide. <br> <br>Further investigating the evolutionary branches of humanity, he explores the mounting biological evidence supporting the aquatic ape theory--that our ancestors spent one or more evolutionary phases in water--and shows how these aquatic phases of humanity fall neatly into place within his revised timeline of ancient history. Examining the profound similarities of megaliths around the world, including Nabta Playa, Gobekli Tepe, Stonehenge, New Hampshire&#x2019;s Mystery Hill, and the Japanese Oyu circles, the author explains how these precisely placed monuments of quartz were built specifically to produce altered states of consciousness, revealing the spiritual and technological sophistication of their Neolithic builders--a transoceanic civilization fractured by the cataclysmic effects of comets. <br> <br>Tying in his extensive research into Atlantis and Lemuria, Joseph provides a 20-million-year timeline of the rise and fall of ancient civilizations, both human and pre-human, the evolutionary stages of humanity, and the catastrophes and resulting climate changes that triggered them all--events that our relatively young civilization may soon experience.</p><p>Frank Joseph was the editor in chief of <i>Ancient American</i> magazine from 1993 until 2009.

Nine years later, Richard von Mises, one of it pioneers, brought out the first edition of this book &#x2014; what has become the classic treatment of the foundations of probability theory. The present text reproduces the most authoritative translation of the definitive 1951 German edition, which was fully revised in the light of over two decades of developments in the field.<br>Step by step, in clear, simple language and with exceptionally well chosen examples, the author unfolds what in all likelihood is still the most comprehensive investigation ever undertaken of probability, its relation to statistic, and its truth-finding value. Professor Richard von Mises (1883&#x2013;1953) was a world-renowned mathematician, aeronautical scientists, and positivist philosopher. Like all of his books, this one is rigorously logical and systematic, and at the same time thoroughly grounded in empirical evidence and practical situations.<br>First, Professor Mises derives a logically clear concept of probability and applies it to the idea of a "collective." He takes into account all the significant earlier approaches &#x2014; from that of Pascal to those of Laplace, Poisson, Venn, Keynes, and others. He devotes particular attention to the theories that appear to contradict his own. Then he determines "the task of probability calculus in mathematical statistics." The Laws of Large Numbers, the theory of errors, and many other relevant topics are thoroughly explored. Professor Mises brings his lucid conceptualizations to bear on virtually every significant practical application of probability and statistics &#x2014; from "absolutely safe" gambling systems, through the sex distribution of infants, to the phenomena of radioactivity.<br>Despite its sophistication, this book requires no knowledge of higher mathematics. Yet physicists will appreciate its substantial discussion of the crucial place of statistical problems in modern physics.

We've hung out together at conferences and swooned over each other's books. When she was able to work on&nbsp;<i>Vampire Academy: The Ultimate Guide</i>, I couldn't believe how lucky I was to have someone who was already a fan of the VA world and whose writing I personally loved. I'm just as excited about her Falling Kingdoms series and couldn't resist this chance to ask her some questions about&nbsp;<i>Rebel Spring</i>, the next book in the series!</b></b><br><br>Morgan Rhodes: I was thrilled for the chance to write the VA Ultimate Guide! I remember Richelle telling me there were plans for the book and I piped up with: &#x201c;I totally want to write that!&#x201d; And what fun it was to delve back into a series that I loved (and am still in love with thanks to the wonderful Bloodlines spinoff). I&#x2019;m counting down the days for the VA movie! Richelle is not only a friend, but one of my very favorite authors, so it&#x2019;s a real honor to be interviewed by her about&nbsp;<i>Rebel Spring</i>.<br><br><b><b>RM: So without further ado, let&#x2019;s start talking about the new book. The world of Falling Kingdoms is so vivid and detail-rich. When it comes to world-building for these novels, where do you get your inspiration?</b></b><br><br>MR: I get my inspiration from pretty much everywhere, although I&#x2019;m visually inspired by some of my favorite TV shows and movies, which run the gamut from&nbsp;<i>Lord of the Rings</i>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<i>The Princess Bride</i>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<i>Game of Thrones</i>, to name just a few.<br><br><b><b>RM: At the end of&nbsp;<i>Falling Kingdoms</i>, things are looking pretty bleak in Mytica. Is it fair to say that&nbsp;<i>Rebel Spring</i>&nbsp;will be quite a bit darker than book 1?</b></b><br><br>MR: The stakes have been raised and sharpened, for sure. Blood will spill and lives will be lost. But I don&#x2019;t think I would ever want to write a book that was unrelentingly bleak from beginning to end. I can promise that&nbsp;<i>Rebel Spring&nbsp;</i>contains plenty of comic relief and romance to counterbalance the darker bits.<br><br><b><b>RM: The Falling Kingdoms books are written from multiple POVs, and each of your narrators has such a unique voice and perspective. How does your experience vary from POV to POV? Are there some characters that are more difficult than others? Do you have a favorite?</b></b><br><br>MR: It&#x2019;s been a wonderful and exciting challenge to write in multiple points of view from my diverse cast. I will admit, some POVs are always a joy to write and others prove to be a challenge. I try to put myself in the head of that character and see the world from their eyes, no matter who they are or what their goals are. I get into the heads of a couple different characters in&nbsp;<i>Rebel Spring</i>, including a villain who definitely sees things from a darker angle than anything I&#x2019;ve written before &#x2013; which was fun. The characters whose scenes I most look forward to writing since they are very specific personalities and basically take over and make things easier for me are Cleo and Magnus. They tend to surprise me while the other characters usually stick to the outline!<br><br><b><b>RM: Let&#x2019;s talk body count. You&#x2019;re very good at making me fall in love with your characters, but you&#x2019;re also very good at killing them off when I least expect it. How do you decide the who, how, when, and why when it comes to killing off your characters?</b></b><br><br>MR: I never knew how much I enjoyed killing characters until I started writing this series. *evil grin* However! I like to think those who get the ax (sometimes, um, literally) are necessary deaths. It&#x2019;s all for a purpose, to change another character in the face of their shock and grief, to lead them down a path they never would have taken before, and to spark a desire for revolution and vengeance in the hearts of those who might previously have been passive and peaceful. Plus, I always think when things seem a bit too ideal and characters are getting too comfortable, it&#x2019;s a good time to get a few heads rolling to keep things interesting for readers &#x2013; and for me as the writer!<br><br><b><b>RM:</b>&nbsp;<b>What&#x2019;s going on with Magnus? He seems like kind of a jerk in&nbsp;<i>Falling Kingdoms</i>, but I get the sense he&#x2019;s got a soft spot.</b></b><br><br>MR: With a father like King Gaius, whose nickname is the &#x201c;King of Blood,&#x201d; it would be pretty hard for a prince to grow up as a nice dude with a sunny disposition! Magnus really came alive on the page for me, more so than any other character in the cast. Initially, he was supposed to be a jerk through and through, but he&#x2019;s really more of a lost soul whose entire life has been devoted to attempting to gain his cruel and driven father&#x2019;s love and respect. However, Magnus has begun to learn that he might have a different set of morals than the king, even though he knows following in Daddy&#x2019;s footsteps would make life easier for him. This isn&#x2019;t to say that Magnus hasn&#x2019;t made (and will make) some rather dreadful decisions that will certainly cast a shadow over his future relationships and experiences.<br><br><b><b>RM: Jonas has a lot of axes to grind by the end of book 1. What can we expect from him in&nbsp;<i>Rebel Spring</i>?</b></b><br><br>MR: I think the main thing with Jonas is that beneath his thirst for vengeance (focused on both the murderer of his brother Aron and King Gaius) is that he really does mean well. He cares about the people of downtrodden Paelsia, and he&#x2019;s someone, unlike his fellow countrymen, who doesn&#x2019;t believe his future is ruled by uncontrollable fate. In&nbsp;<i>Rebel Spring</i>, Jonas has been thrust into the position of rebel leader, which will be a challenge for him on many levels.<br><br><b><b>RM: Okay, ultimate personality test: Are you a Cleo or a Lucia?</b></b><br><br>MR: Both are princesses from vastly different kingdoms and upbringings &#x2013; Cleo is a girl who has favored parties and frivolity in the past, while Lucia prefers learning and solitude. Cleo is stubborn and sometimes reckless, and Lucia is more measured and controlled, but may be considered na�ve in many ways. I wouldn&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m much like either princess, really, although I am blond like Cleo and I love books like Lucia. :)<br><br><b><b>RM: Lastly, can you talk a little bit about your writing process?&nbsp;</b></b><br><br>MR: It would be next to impossible to undertake a large tapestry of a series like Falling Kingdoms if I didn&#x2019;t plan a lot of it ahead of time. I work from a detailed outline and map out character goals and conflicts and relationship arcs, but I&#x2019;m still surprised by some of the things my characters say and do that can take me in a direction different from what was meticulously planned. So far, it&#x2019;s been a lot of fun to explore these unexpected paths to see where they lead.</p><p>Morgan Rhodes is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the&nbsp;Falling Kingdoms&nbsp;series.

The news of Chief Basilius&#x2019;s murder spread swiftly, and vil�lages throughout the land fell into a deep mourning. They grieved a great man&#x2014;a sorcerer who could touch magic and whom many in this land with no official religion thought of as a living god. </p><p>&#x201c;What will we do without him?&#x201d; was a constant cry in the days and weeks that followed. &#x201c;We are lost!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Honestly,&#x201d; Lysandra grumbled to her older brother, Gregor, as they snuck out of their family&#x2019;s cottage at twilight. &#x201c;He never showed any true magic. It was all just talk! It&#x2019;s like they forget he taxed us all to death. The chief was a liar and a thief who lived high and mighty at his compound, sucking back wine and food while the rest of us starved!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hush,&#x201d; Gregor warned, but he was laughing. &#x201c;You speak your mind far too much, &#x201c;I can handle trouble.&#x201d; Lysandra aimed her arrow at the target on a tree twenty paces away and let go. She hit the very center. Pride warmed her on this cool evening and she glanced at her brother for his reaction. </p><p>&#x201c;Nice shot.&#x201d; His grin widened and he nudged her aside to take his turn. &#x201c;However, this will be nicer.&#x201d; </p><p>Easily, he split her arrow in two. She couldn&#x2019;t help but be im�pressed. They&#x2019;d been practicing like this for months in secret. She&#x2019;d had to beg her brother to share his knowledge of archery, but he finally relented. It was unusual for a girl to be taught how to use weapons. Most believed girls were meant to cook and clean and look after the men. </p><p>Which was ridiculous. Especially since Lysandra was a natural at this. </p><p>&#x201c;Do you think they&#x2019;ll be back?&#x201d; she asked Gregor quietly, scan�ning the small village nearby, the thatched roofs, the mud and stone exteriors. Smoke wafted from the chimneys of many of the small homes. </p><p>His jaw tensed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; </p><p>A week ago, important-looking representatives of the con�queror, King Gaius, visited their village, asking for volunteers to go east and begin work on a road the king wanted quickly built, one that would snake not only through Paelsia, but through the neighboring lands of Auranos and Limeros as well. </p><p>Gregor and their father had been chosen to greet the men, and the pair had stood up to the bright smiles and smooth words without allowing themselves to be intimidated or swayed. The vil�lage had declined the offer. </p><p>The King of Blood thought he now ruled them. But he was sorely mistaken. They might be poor, but they were proud. No one </p><p>had the right to tell them what to do. </p><p>King Gaius&#x2019;s men had left without argument. </p><p>&#x201c;Idiot Basilius,&#x201d; Lysandra mumbled. &#x201c;He may have trusted the king, but we&#x2019;re smart enough not to. Basilius deserved to be skew�ered. It was only a matter of time. Makes me sick to my stomach that he&#x2019;d be such a fool.&#x201d; Her next arrow flew off course. She needed to work harder on her concentration. &#x201c;Tell me more about the rebels who plan to stand up against the king.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Why do you want to know? Do you want to be the one of the few girls to join their ranks?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I do.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Come, little Lys.&#x201d; Gregor laughed and grabbed her wrist. &#x201c;There have to be a few rabbits we can find to practice your aim on next. Why waste arrows on trees and breath on silly words? Don&#x2019;t worry about the rebels. If anyone will soon be joining them in their fight against the king, it&#x2019;ll be me.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Not silly,&#x201d; she mumbled. </p><p>But he did have a point&#x2014;at least when it came to their target practice. The trees were scarce here anyway. Most of the area was brown and dry with a few small greener areas in which her mother and other women tended vegetable gardens that, each year, yielded fewer and fewer vegetables, but many tears. Her mother had not stopped crying since she&#x2019;d heard of Basilius&#x2019;s death. </p><p>It wrenched Lysandra&#x2019;s heart to see her mother so upset, so inconsolable, but she tried to reason with her. &#x201c;I believe we make our own destinies, every last one of us,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told her mother last night. &#x201c;Who leads us makes no difference.&#x201d; </p><p>This was met with a sad, weary look of patience. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so naive, daughter. I pray it won&#x2019;t lead you astray.&#x201d; </p><p>And now her mother prayed to the dead chief about her rule-breaking daughter. This wasn&#x2019;t unexpected. Lysandra had always caused her mother grief by not being an acceptable daughter who did acceptable things. Lysandra was accustomed to not fitting in with her friends, who couldn&#x2019;t understand her fascination with making arrows until she got blisters on her fingers or staying outside until her nose burned so red it practically glowed in the dark. </p><p>Gregor put his arm out to halt Lysandra&#x2019;s steps. </p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; she asked. </p><p>&#x201c;Look.&#x201d; </p><p>They were less than a mile from the village. Before them was a small clearing, barren of any vegetation at all. It was surrounded by dry bushes and leafless trees. An old woman, one Lysandra rec�ognized as Talia, the eldest in their village, stood in the middle of the clearing. The carcass of a red fox lay in front of her. The woman had drained the blood from the animal into a wooden cup. With this blood, she drew symbols on the parched, cracked earth with the tip of her finger. </p><p>Lysandra had never seen anything like it in her life. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s Talia doing? What&#x2019;s she drawing?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Four symbols,&#x201d; Gregor said, his voice hushed. &#x201c;Do you know what they are?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No, what?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The symbols are of the elements: fire, air, water, and earth.&#x201d; He pointed to each in turn, a triangle, a spiral, two stacked wavy lines, and a circle within a circle. His throat worked as he swal�lowed hard. &#x201c;I had no idea. Our village elder . . . she&#x2019;s a witch. An Oldling.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Wait. You&#x2019;re saying that old, simple-minded Talia&#x2019;s a . . . witch?&#x201d; </p><p>She waited for him to start grinning and tell her he was just jok�ing. But he was serious&#x2014;deadly serious. </p><p>Gregor&#x2019;s brows drew together. &#x201c;I had my suspicions, but this is the proof. She&#x2019;s kept her secret well over all the years. You know what can happen to witches.&#x201d; </p><p>In the neighboring kingdom of Limeros they were burned. Hanged. Beheaded. Witches were considered evil, even here in Paelsia. Bad luck. A curse upon this land making it wither away and die. In Limeros, many believed that such witches were what had cursed that land to turn to ice. </p><p>Lysandra remembered Talia&#x2019;s unusual reaction when she&#x2019;d learned the chief had been murdered by King Gaius. She&#x2019;d nodded once, grimly, brushed off her dusty skirts, and said four words: </p><p>&#x201c;And so it begins.&#x201d; </p><p>Everyone thought the old woman was mad so they paid no attention to her ramblings, but for some reason those words had resonated with Lysandra and sent a chill down her spine. </p><p>&#x201c;So what begins?&#x201d; She&#x2019;d caught the old woman&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; </p><p>Talia had turned her pale, watery eyes on Lysandra. &#x201c;The end, my dear girl. The end begins.&#x201d; </p><p>It took a moment for Lysandra to speak again to Gregor, her heart pounding loud in her ears. &#x201c;What do you mean by Old-ling?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s one who worships the elements. It&#x2019;s an old religion&#x2014; older than anything except elementia itself. And by the looks of this,&#x201d; he nodded toward the clearing, &#x201c;Talia is working blood magic tonight.&#x201d; </p><p>A shiver went down Lysandra&#x2019;s spine. Blood magic. </p><p>She&#x2019;d heard of such things before, but had never seen any proof until now. Gregor had always been more of a believer than she in that which was unseen and rarely spoken about&#x2014;magic, witches, legends. Lysandra barely listened to the storytellers, interested more in tangible facts that whimsical tales. Now, she wished she&#x2019;d paid more attention </p><p>&#x201c;For what purpose?&#x201d; she asked. </p><p>Just then, Talia&#x2019;s eyes shot directly at the two of them, hawk�like, picking them out in the dying light of dusk. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too late,&#x201d; she said loud enough for them to hear her. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t summon enough magic to protect us, only to see the shadows of what is to come. I&#x2019;m powerless to stop them.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Talia!&#x201d; Lysandra&#x2019;s voice was uncertain as she called out to the woman. &#x201c;What are you doing? Come away from there, it&#x2019;s not right.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You must do something for me, Lysandra Barbas.&#x201d; </p><p>Lysandra glanced at Gregor, puzzled, before looking back at Talia. &#x201c;What do you want me to do?&#x201d; </p><p>Talia held her blood covered hands out to either side of her, her eyes growing wider and wider as if she saw something horrifying all around her. Something truly evil. &#x201c;Run!&#x201d; </p><p>At that moment, a huge flaming arrow arched through the air and hit Talia directly in the center of her chest. She staggered backward and fell to the ground, her clothes catching fire quicker than Lysandra could comprehend. </p><p>Lysandra gripped Gregor&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s dead!&#x201d; </p><p>He craned his head urgently to look back in the direction the arrow had come from, then yanked Lysandra to the side to avoid another arrow aimed directly at them that instead sliced into a tree trunk. &#x201c;I was afraid of this.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Afraid of what?&#x201d; Lysandra spotted a figure fifty paces away, armed with a crossbow. &#x201c;He killed her! Gregor&#x2014;he killed her! Who is he?&#x201d; </p><p>The figure had spotted then and had begun to give chase. Gregor swore loudly and took hold of her wrist. &#x201c;Come on, we need to hurry!&#x201d; </p><p>She didn&#x2019;t argue. Clutching each other&#x2019;s hands, they ran back to the village as fast as they could. </p><p>It was on fire. </p><p>Chaos had swiftly descended upon the village. Horrified screams of fear and pain pierced the air&#x2014;screams of the dying. Scores of men in red uniforms astride horses galloped through the streets, holding torches that they used ruthlessly to set each cot�tage ablaze. Townspeople ran from their burning homes, trying to escape a fiery death. The sharp swords in other guards&#x2019; hands fell upon many, slicing through flesh and bone. </p><p>&#x201c;Gregor!&#x201d; Lysandra cried as they came to a wrenching halt, hid�den from the soldiers behind a stone cottage. &#x201c;King Gaius&#x2014;this is his doing! He&#x2019;s killing everyone!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We told him no. He didn&#x2019;t like that answer.&#x201d; He turned and took her by her arms, staring fiercely into her eyes. &#x201c;Lysandra. Little sister. You need to go. You need to run far away from here.&#x201d; </p><p>The fire heated the air, turning dusk to nightmarish daylight all around her. &#x201c;What are you talking about? I can&#x2019;t go!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Lys&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I need to find our mother!&#x201d; She shoved away from Gregor and raced through the village, dodging any obstacle in her path. She staggered to a halt outside of her cottage, now engulfed in flame. </p><p>Her mother&#x2019;s body lay halfway across the threshold. Her father&#x2019;s body was only ten paces away, lying in a pool of blood. </p><p>Before she could fully register the horror, Gregor caught up. </p><p>He grabbed her and threw her over his shoulder, running beyond the village limits before dropping her clumsily to the ground. He tossed her bow and a handful of arrows at her. </p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re dead,&#x201d; she whispered. Her heart felt like a stone that had dropped into her stomach. </p><p>&#x201c;I was watching and listening as I ran. The king&#x2019;s guards are gathering any survivors up and they will make them work the road.&#x201d; His voice broke. &#x201c;I must go back to help the others. Go&#x2014; find the rebels. Do what you can to stop this from happening any�where else, Lys. Do you understand me?&#x201d; </p><p>She shook her head, her eyes burning from the smoke and from hateful tears. &#x201c;No, I won&#x2019;t leave you! You&#x2019;re all I have left!&#x201d; </p><p>Gregor took her chin sharply in his hand. &#x201c;Follow me,&#x201d; he growled, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;ll put an arrow through your heart myself to save you from whatever fate now lies before our friends and neigh�bors.&#x201d; </p><p>It was the last he said before he turned and ran back to the village. </p><p>And all she could do was watch him go. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JONAS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AURANOS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the King of Blood wanted to make a point, he made it as sharp as possible. </p><p>It was midday. With bone-chilling thuds, the executioner&#x2019;s ax fell upon the necks of three accused rebels, severing their heads from their bodies. The blood dripped through the stocks and spread across the smooth stone ground before a swelling crowd a thousand deep. And all Jonas could do was watch in horror as the heads were then mounted upon tall spikes in the palace square for all to see. </p><p>Three boys who&#x2019;d barely reached manhood, now dead for being menaces and troublemakers. The severed heads stared at the crowd with blank eyes and slack expressions. Crimson blood trickled down the wooden spikes while the bodies were taken away to be burned. </p><p>The king who had quickly and brutally conquered this land did not give second chances&#x2014;especially not to anyone who publicly opposed him. Rebellion would be dealt with swiftly and remorse�lessly&#x2014;and publicly. </p><p>With each deadly fall of the blade, a growing uneasiness slith�ered through the masses like a heavy mist they could no longer ignore. Auranos had once been free and prosperous and at peace&#x2014; but now someone with a taste for blood was seated upon the throne. </p><p>The crowd stood shoulder to shoulder in the large square. Close by, Jonas could see young nobles, well dressed with tense jaws and wary expressions. Two fat, drunk men clinking their wine-filled goblets together as if toasting to a day filled with pos�sibility. An old, gray-haired woman with a deeply lined face and a fine silk dress, her gaze darting around suspiciously. All were clambering for the best spot to see the king when he entered onto the marble balcony high above. The air was scented with smoke from both chimneys and cigarillos and with the aromas of baking bread, roasting meat, and the fragrant oils and cloyingly floral per�fumes liberally used by many in lieu of bathing regularly. And the noise&#x2014;a cacophony of voices, both conspiratorial whispers and deep-throated shouts&#x2014;made it impossible to think clearly. </p><p>The Auranian palace glittered before them like a massive golden crown, its spires rising high up into the cloudless blue sky. It was set in the direct center of the City of Gold, a walled city two miles wide and deep. The walls themselves were heavily veined in gold, which caught the sunlight and reflected it like a pile of gold coins in the center of acres of green. Inside, cobbled roads led to villas, businesses, taverns, and shops. Only the privileged and important were able to make this city their home. But today, the gates had opened to all who wished to hear the king&#x2019;s speech. </p><p>&#x201c;This place is impressive.&#x201d; Brion&#x2019;s voice was hard to hear above the incessant chatter of the throng. </p><p>&#x201c;You think?&#x201d; Jonas shifted his grim attention from the impaled heads. His friend&#x2019;s dark blue eyes were fixed upon the glittering palace as if it were something he could steal and sell for profit. </p><p>&#x201c;I could get used to living here. A roof over my head&#x2014;golden tiles at my pampered feet. All the food and drink I can swallow.

Her eyes kept fluttering closed and popping open and she&#x2019;d mutter, &#x201c;Oh dear,&#x201d; every once in a while. My boyfriend, the aforementioned Ewan, would be in Edinburgh soon to pick me up, so I saw no harm in waiting out on Gran&#x2019;s front stoop and letting her take a much-needed nap.</p><p>When I kissed her papery cheek and said good-bye, Gran offered me a warm smile, her lids already drooping. Letting myself out of the large house, I hesitated a moment in the spacious hallway. Her house hadn&#x2019;t seemed so big when Granddad was alive, but ever since he&#x2019;d passed away three years ago, the house magically grew bigger and colder. Whenever I could, as I had done last night, I&#x2019;d travel from my parents&#x2019; house in our small town to stay with Gran for the night, sometimes even the whole weekend. Since Gran&#x2019;s house had always felt more like home than my parents&#x2019; did, I took any opportunity I could to stay with her.</p><p>However, I couldn&#x2019;t stay the whole weekend because Ewan&#x2019;s band was playing a gig tonight and he wanted me there. He was the band&#x2019;s bassist. I was really excited to see him play, although I wasn&#x2019;t much looking forward to girls trying to chat him up after the show, like my friend Caro warned me would probably happen.</p><p>Shutting Gran&#x2019;s door, I turned and walked down a few steps to stand near the bottom of the stoop so Ewan could see me. He was seventeen, a few years older than me, and had just gotten his driver&#x2019;s license. He liked any old excuse to drive his wee, banged-up Punto, so I didn&#x2019;t feel bad about dragging his arse all the way to Edinburgh to come get me.</p><p>Digging through my bag for my phone and headphones so I could pass the time listening to music, I heard what sounded like a foot sliding along concrete behind me and I jerked around in surprise.</p><p>My eyes instantly collided with those of a boy.</p><p>He stood on the stoop of the house next door, a few steps farther up than me, and he was regarding me with something akin to shock. As I took him in, I felt my heart rate start to pick up.</p><p>His strawberry blond hair was slightly too long and disheveled, but he worked it because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I sucked in a breath, suddenly feeling a flutter of nerves in my stomach. The boy was utterly gorgeous. They didn&#x2019;t grow them like him at my school. As he stepped slowly down the stoop, the startlingly light green color of his eyes became clearer. They were &#x201c;wow&#x201d; eyes that I felt like I could drown in, and it occurred to me that perhaps I just might. When our eye contact finally broke, it was only because he was distracted by my hair.</p><p>Self-conscious, I tucked a strand behind my ear. The boy&#x2019;s eyes followed the movement. I&#x2019;d been mocked for my hair for a long time when I was little, but as I got older I started to get compliments on it. This meant I was really unsure about other people&#x2019;s reaction to my hair, but I refused to change it. I&#x2019;d inherited my hair from my mum. It was like the one thing we had in common.</p><p>It hung down to just above my bottom in soft waves and natural ringlets. Not ginger, not strawberry blond. It was closer to auburn, but even then it was just a hint too red to be auburn. When the sun or artificial light hit my hair, Gran said it was like a halo of fire around my head.</p><p>The boy&#x2019;s eyes returned to mine.</p><p>A really awkward length of time passed as we continued to stare at each other, and I could feel myself begin to squirm under the surprising tension that had sprung up between this stranger and me.</p><p>Searching for a way out, I dropped my gaze to his black T-shirt. It was a The Airborne Toxic Event shirt and I felt my lips curling into a pleased smile. TATE was one of my favorite bands. &#x201c;Have you seen them live?&#x201d; I asked more than a little enviously.</p><p>The boy glanced down at his shirt as though he&#x2019;d forgotten what he was wearing. When he looked back at me, his mouth kicked up at the corner. &#x201c;I wish.&#x201d;</p><p>I felt a rush of excitement at the sound of his voice and unconsciously stepped a little closer to the wrought-iron fence that separated us from each other&#x2019;s stoop. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to see them live.&#x201d;</p><p>He moved closer and I tilted my head back. He was tall. I was a small five foot three and the boy was almost a foot taller than me. My gaze wandered, no longer under my control, taking in his broad shoulders, down his lean, muscular arms to the big hand he had wrapped around one of the wrought-iron spearheads that embellished the fence. I felt a flip in my belly at the thought of being touched by one of those hands. They were masculine but graceful and long-fingered.</p><p>I flushed, thinking about what Ewan had done to me last week, except suddenly imagining this boy in his place. Guiltily, I chewed on my lower lip as I looked back up at the boy.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t seem to notice that my thoughts had meandered into the indecent. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a fan of TATE?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded, feeling suddenly shy of this person who had elicited such a strong reaction in me.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re my favorite band.&#x201d; He gave me a small grin and I instantly wanted to know what he looked like when he laughed.</p><p>&#x201c;One of mine too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; He leaned in a little closer, his eyes searching my face as though I was the most interesting thing he&#x2019;d ever seen. &#x201c;What other bands do you like?&#x201d;</p><p>The thrill of having his attention broke through the uncharacteristic shyness and I rattled off all the bands I could think of that I&#x2019;d been listening to lately.</p><p>When I was done he rewarded me with a smile, and that smile winded me it was so good. There was something flirtatious there but at the same time boyish, charmingly boyish and utterly endearing. It was a great smile. A really, really great smile.</p><p>I sighed inwardly and leaned farther into the fence.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; he asked me, his voice low because we were so close now we could whisper and we&#x2019;d hear each other. I could actually feel the heat from his body, and realizing we were standing quite intimately made me hugely aware of my own body as well as his. I flushed inwardly again, thankful I wasn&#x2019;t a typical redhead with blush-prone skin.</p><p>&#x201c;Shannon,&#x201d; I replied, sure there was a hush in the air between us and afraid to break whatever it was by being too loud. &#x201c;Yours?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cole,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Cole Walker.&#x201d;</p><p>That made me smile. It fit him perfectly. &#x201c;You sound like a hero.&#x201d;</p><p>Cole grinned. &#x201c;A hero?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Like if there was a zombie apocalypse, the hero who tries to save everyone would have a name like Cole Walker.&#x201d;</p><p>His chuckle warmed me through and through, as did the way his eyes brightened with amusement. &#x201c;Zombie apocalypse?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It could happen,&#x201d; I insisted because I never liked to rule out any eventuality in life.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t seem all that worried that it could.&#x201d;</p><p>That was because I wasn&#x2019;t. I shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just never understood why people are afraid of zombies. They move really slowly and are brain-dead.&#x201d;</p><p>Cole snorted. &#x201c;Two very fair points.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled. &#x201c;So, are you a hero, Cole Walker?&#x201d;</p><p>He scratched the side of his chin, looking off into the distance. &#x201c;What is a hero, really?&#x201d;</p><p>Surprised by the deep and apparently serious question, I shrugged. &#x201c;I suppose it&#x2019;s someone that saves people.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes flicked back to me. &#x201c;Yeah, I suppose it is.&#x201d;</p><p>Trying to lighten the mood, I gave him a flirty smile. &#x201c;So, do you save people?&#x201d;</p><p>Cole laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only fifteen. Give me a chance.&#x201d;</p><p>We were the same age, then. I was surprised. He could pass for eighteen. &#x201c;You are really tall for fifteen.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes drifted over me, a small smile playing on his lips. &#x201c;A lot of people must seem tall to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you calling me short?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you saying you&#x2019;re not short?&#x201d;</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not delusional. It&#x2019;s just not polite to comment on a girl&#x2019;s shortness. For all you know I&#x2019;m really mad at the world because I&#x2019;m vertically challenged.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;m really mad at the world because I&#x2019;m tall.&#x201d;</p><p>I gave him a look that said <i>as if</i> and he burst out laughing.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;m not mad at being tall. But you shouldn&#x2019;t be mad about your height.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not,&#x201d; I hurried to assure him. &#x201c;I was just making a point.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A pointless point.&#x201d;</p><p>I giggled, thinking over our bizarre conversation. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>Cole smiled, and I felt myself go all hot inside again at the way he was looking at me. &#x201c;I doubt anyone notices your height anyway. You&#x2019;ve got all that great hair and those amazing eyes to distract them.&#x201d; As soon as he said it he flushed and ran a hand through his own hair, as if embarrassed he&#x2019;d complimented me out loud.</p><p>My cheeks burned with pleasure. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got amazing eyes too.&#x201d;</p><p>His momentary shyness instantly disappeared at my compliment. Cole leaned forward over the fence. &#x201c;Please tell me you live here.&#x201d;</p><p>Before I could answer, a loud honk shattered the intensity between us and I jerked my head up to see Ewan approaching in his old Punto. Reality came crashing back down around me, and for some reason I felt a weird sense of loss when I looked back at Cole. &#x201c;I live in Glasgow,&#x201d; I told him regretfully. I gestured to the car. &#x201c;My boyfriend&#x2019;s here to pick me up.&#x201d;</p><p>Disappointment flashed in Cole&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;Boyfriend?&#x201d; His gaze flew toward the car and I watched his face fall.</p><p>My heart sank in my chest. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I whispered, not really sure what I was apologizing for.</p><p>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; he murmured.</p><p>Ewan honked the horn again and I blanched, moving down the steps, my eyes still on Cole. We held each other&#x2019;s gaze as I walked over to the car and slowly, reluctantly, got into it.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, baby,&#x201d; Ewan said, finally causing me to break my connection with Cole.</p><p>I gave my boyfriend a tremulous smile. &#x201c;Hi.&#x201d;</p><p>He leaned over and kissed me before settling back into his seat to drive away.</p><p>Panicked, I turned back to my window to find Cole, but the stoop where he&#x2019;d stood was now empty. A heavy feeling settled over me.</p><p>&#x201c;Who was that?&#x201d; Ewan asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The guy on the stairs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; <i>But I hope I get to find out.</i></p><p>Ewan started chattering on about the band, not bothering to ask me how my night had been or how Gran had seemed even though I&#x2019;d told him I was worried about her. As the old car took me away from Scotland Street amid his incessant chatter, I felt like fate had just handed me two cups and I&#x2019;d stupidly drunk from the wrong one.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p><i>Edinburgh <br>Nine years later</i></p><p>INKARNATE.</p><p>I stared up at the sign above the tattoo studio on Leith Walk, worrying my lip between my teeth. There was nothing for it. I had to open the doors and step inside.</p><p>I blew out a deep breath until my lips formed a disgruntled pout. The sign for INKarnate was painted in bold font across a long panel of glass above its door. The two large panels of glass on either side of the glossy black door were covered in pictures of tattooed limbs, artwork, and bold red-and-purple signs that screamed TATTOOS, PIERCINGS, TATTOO REMOVALS at the passing public. In the center of the panel farthest away from me were two large white signs that proclaimed proudly SCOTLAND&#x2019;S #1 TATTOO STUDIO and MULTI-AWARD WINNER.</p><p>Even I, who had no tattoos to speak of, had heard of INKarnate.</p><p>Okay, true, I&#x2019;d dated quite a few blokes with tattoos, but that wasn&#x2019;t the reason I&#x2019;d heard of Stu Motherwell&#x2019;s tattoo studio. I&#x2019;d heard of it because his signs didn&#x2019;t lie and he&#x2019;d even been on television a few times over the past few years. Stu had owned INKarnate for about thirty years now. He was an extremely talented and ambitious artist and was purported to only hire fantastic artists to work alongside him.</p><p>You&#x2019;d think I&#x2019;d be absolutely over-the-moon to get an interview for the admin assistant/reception position they needed to fill. However, INKarnate embodied everything I was running from at the moment. Everything that was bad for me.</p><p>I&#x2019;d only applied for the job because admin jobs were scarce.</p><p>Ironic that this should be the only application that had produced a response.</p><p>What could I do, though? I crossed my arms over my chest, my eyes glued to the sign TATTOOS. I&#x2019;d had to get away from Glasgow, and I had nowhere to go&#x2014;Edinburgh was the only place I knew well enough to feel comfortable moving to, and it was expensive as heck. The hotel I was staying in was really a hostel and I couldn&#x2019;t afford to stay even there that much longer. Although I had enough in my savings for two months&#x2019; rent on a really crappy flat, I wouldn&#x2019;t get a lease until I found a job.</p><p>I needed to eat and I needed a roof over my head.</p><p>As Gran used to say, beggars can&#x2019;t be choosers.</p><p>Letting my hands fall to my sides (defensive posture wasn&#x2019;t really a good way to start an interview), I waited for a woman with her pram to pass by the studio before striding up to the door and pushing inside. An old-fashioned bell at odds with the rest of the decor jingled above the door as I entered.</p><p>My low-heeled boots sounded loud on the expensive-looking white-tiled flooring. It was shot through with chips of silver mosaic pieces and was more elegant than I would have expected for a tattoo studio.</p><p>For a few moments I eyed the rest of the interior. It was like a typical tattoo studio but less&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. grungy. The main room was large and spacious. A small curved black marble counter sat to my left, and on it was a shiny iMac I would have given my eyeteeth for. Behind the counter was a massive closet I couldn&#x2019;t miss because its door was open, revealing a chaotic mass of files on the shelves inside. Opposite the counter on the other side of the room was a huge, well-worn black leather L-shaped sofa that looked really comfy. A glass coffee table was positioned in front of it, with a scatter of magazines on it and what looked like a bowl of shiny-wrapped toffees. Directly ahead of me was a mini gallery of sorts. The walls were white and nearly every inch of them was covered in tattoo concepts. The only walls that had been left bare were the partition walls placed here and there throughout the space. On them were television screens where indie and rock music played softly as a sound track to snapshots and video footage of the artists&#x2019; portfolios.</p><p>It was all about art here.</p><p>But where were the artists?</p><p>I stared around at the emptiness, my eyes eventually coming to a stop on a door near the back left-hand corner. I could hear the buzz of a tattoo needle. The workshops must be back there.</p><p>Should I venture in?</p><p>I hesitated only to be shuffled forward by someone attempting to open the entrance door. Moving out of the way, I gave the young man an apologetic smile.</p><p>&#x201c;All right?&#x201d; He nodded at me in greeting before swaggering over to the counter. He hit an old-fashioned bell a few times.</p><p>Oh. Okay.</p><p>A few seconds later a figure appeared in the doorway at the back. A huge, hulking beast of a figure. I stared openmouthed as he moved toward us, and slowly recognition hit me.</p><p>The graying beard and long wiry hair, the jolly grin and crinkles around the b...</p></p><h2>Do Dice Play God?: The Mathematics of Uncertainty</h2><p><b>A celebrated mathematician explores how math helps us make sense of the unpredictable</b><br>We would like to believe we can know things for certain. We want to be able to figure out who will win an election, if the stock market will crash, or if a suspect definitely committed a crime. But the odds are not in our favor. Life is full of uncertainty --- indeed, scientific advances indicate that the universe might be fundamentally inexact --- and humans are terrible at guessing. When asked to predict the outcome of a chance event, we are almost always wrong. <br>Thankfully, there is hope. As award-winning mathematician Ian Stewart reveals, over the course of history, mathematics has given us some of the tools we need to better manage the uncertainty that pervades our lives. From forecasting, to medical research, to figuring out how to win <i>Let's Make a Deal</i>, <i>Do Dice Play God</i>? is a surprising and satisfying tour of what we can know, and what we never will.</p><p><b>Ian Stewart </b>is emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Warwick.

In <em>The Art Lover</em> Carole Maso has created an elegant and moving narrative about a woman experiencing (and reliving) the most painful transitions of her life. Caroline, the novel's protagonist, returns to New York after the death of her fatherostensibly to wrap things up and take care of necessary "business"where her memory and imagination conspire to lay before her all her griefs and joys in a rebellious progression. In different voices, employing a collage-like fragmentation, Maso gently unfolds <em>The Art Lover</em> in much the same way the fragile and prehistoric fiddlehead fern unfolds throughout the novel, bringing with subtle grace the ever-entangled feelings of grief and love into full and tender view. Various illustrations throughout.</p><p>Carole Maso is author of the novels AVA, The American Woman in the Chinese Hat, Ghost Dance, The Art Lover, and Defiance. She has also written several books of nonfiction. Maso is a professor of Literary Arts at Brown University.Caroline, a novelist and poet, returns from an isolated artists colony to Manhattan, where her widowed, art-historian father has recently died. As one strand of the narrative follows her rediscovery of the city--and of a friend diagnosed with AIDS--another follows the characters she creates in her prose; interspersed throughout are reproductions of pictures and newspaper clippings that inspire her. This narrative cord ruptures with the introduction of "Carole," the persona of Maso, and descriptions of herself at work on the novel while her own beloved friend is dying, Carole/the writer's art incapable of saving him. Despite its trendy structure and themes, this work is steered by anything but a narcissistic postmodernism. Maso ( Ghost Dance ) is not content to muse on the relationship between life and art; she brings to life a "bombardment of images and sounds," fashioning a pattern of astonishing complexity and beauty. The tough-mindedness, originality and wit of her perceptions are intoxicating. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wilderness Survival Handbook: Primitive Skills for Short-Term Survival and Long-Term Comfort</h2><p><p><b>An essential guide to everything you need to stay sheltered, fed, healthy, and safe in the backcountry</b></p> <p>Organized around the six essentials of survival (shelter, water, food, fire, comfort and health, and navigation), <i>Wilderness Survival Handbook</i> covers 100 skills and techniques, including preserving fire, building pit shelters, toolmaking, stoneboiling cookery, and trapping and hunting animals with handmade tools and weapons.

A frigid winter ascent of Mount McKinley; the vastness of Arabia's Empty Quarter; the impossibly thin air at Everest's summit; the deadly black pressure of an underwater cave; a desperate escape through a Norwegian winter&#x2015;these and thirty-six other stories recount the minutes, hours, and days of lives pushed to the brink. But there is more to adventure than hair's-breadth escapes. By turns charming and tragic, whimsical and nerve-racking, this extraordinary collection gets to the heart of why adventure stories enthrall us. Includes works by Sebastian Junger, Jon Krakauer, Edward Abbey, Tim Cahill, Edward Hoagland, Ernest Shackleton, Freya Stark, and Wilfred Thesiger.</p><p>David Roberts is the award-winning author of twenty-nine books about mountaineering, exploration, and anthropology, including Alone on the Wall which was written with world-class rock climber Alex Honnold, whose historic feats were featured in the film Free Solo.What a pleasure it is to read, in the middle of the Texas summer heat, an excerpt from Robert Falcon Scott's diary of his chilly expedition to the North Pole and then, for a change of climate and scene, an account of Eric Hansen's barefoot walk across the rain forests of Borneo. Roberts (True Summit) has assembled a wonderful collection of excerpts from mostly first-person narratives of adventure travel and exploration from the beginning of the century until today. Each selection is preceded by a short introductory passage written by well-known writers and adventurers (Jon Krakauer and Eric Newby) as well as the lesser known: Joshua Slocum (sailing around the world alone) or H.W. Tilman (descending Nanda Devi). At times the narratives focus on the challenge of the individual vs. nature, at others on the difficulty of teamwork when the struggle becomes overwhelming. All in all, this is a great treasure-trove of daunting human courage, frailty, and persistence in the face of the unknown. It is impressive that these skilled adventurers also happen to be excellent writers. Definitely recommended.DOlga B.

The name was attached to a group of paintings exhibited at the Paris Autumn Salon in 1905 by such artists as Henri Matisse and George Braque. But the group of painters that the name Fauvism referred to had moved on to other things within a year. Still, while Matisse may not have considered himself a Fauvist by 1906, he always acknowledged the movement&#39;s importance. &#34;Fauvism isn&#39;t everything,&#34; he said, &#34;but it is the foundation of everything.&#34; Author Sarah Whitfield does a fine job of providing context for the Fauvist movement and an understanding of its impact on modern art.Les Fauves (the wild beasts) was the nickname given in 1905 to a group of painters led by Henri Matisse. Today, their paintings are among the most popular of all twentieth-century art. Yet when Matisse and his friends - Derain, Vlaminck, Marquet, Dufy and Braque among them - first exhibited their work, the reaction of public and critics was astonishment and often hostility. Using strong, even strident, colors, applied in a manner deriving from Cezanne, Gauguin and Van Gogh, the Fauves took painting back to its basic principles, inspired by primitive art, popular prints and children&#39;s paintings, and paved the way to Cubism. The artists, their work, their relationships, their achievements and the critical and commercial response to their work are discussed in this absorbing book, the first in many years to offer a reappraisal of Fauvism.</p><h2>Rick Steves Best of France</h2><p><b>Hit France's can't-miss art, sights, and bites in two weeks or less with <i>Rick Steves Best of France</i>!

Manhae is a political and cultural hero in Korea, and his works are studied by college students and school children alike.<br> <br><i>Everything Yearned For</i> is a collection of 88 love poems, evocative of the mystical love poetry of Rumi, and even reminiscent of the work of Pablo Neruda.Though Manahe's poetry can be read allegorically on many levels - political and religious - it is completely unlike any other poetry in Buddhist or secular realm.<br> <br>The first poem, "My Lover's Silence," narrates the lover's departure and establishes the enduring themes of the work: the happiness of meeting, the sadness of separation, the agony of longing and waiting, and, most of all, the perfection of love in absence that demands the cost of one's ongoing life, as opposed to the relief of death. The Korean word translated in these poems as "love" and "lover" is nim, though nim has many and broad interpretations. Understandably, the identity of Manhae's lover, or "nim" has been the subject of much speculation.<br> <br>Manhae writes in his own preface:<br> <br><i>"Nim" is not only a human lover but everything yearned for. All beings are nim for the Buddha, and philosophy is the nim of Kant. The spring rain is nim for the rose, and Italy is the nim of Mazzini. Nim is what I love, but it also loves me. If romantic love is freedom, then so is my nim. But aren't you attached to the lofty name of freedom? Don't you also have a nim? If so, it's only your shadow. I write these poems for the young lambs wandering lost on the road home from the darkening plains.</i></p><p>&#34;Francisco Cho has provided the definitive English translation of these remarkable poems. Manhae&#39;s long rhythmical lines seem to sweep forward with an almost Biblical cadence in some places, while in others breaking apart into brief, almost conversational phrases. Their mix of the philophical, mystical, and sensual are uniquely distinctive. A WONDERFUL VOYAGE AWAITS YOU.&#34; -from the foreword by David R. McCann, recipient of the Manhae Prize for Arts and Sciences, and Director of the Korea Insitute at Harvard UniversityReview by Sam Hamill, author of Dumb Luck: &#34;Manhae&#39;s deceptively simple ecstatic poems draw on a tradition that goes back thousands of years.

In his next book, Jim takes the reader along into the wide open spaces of exploring and experiencing God beyond religion. Jim writes, "It is no secret that God can be lost beneath the waving banner of religion. <em>Divine Nobodies</em> is my story of how this happened to me. Sometimes you have to disentangle God from religion, even Christ from Christianity, to find the truth. With the help of some unsuspecting nobodies, I uncovered a new starting line with God. As I've put one foot in front of another, I've experienced God in ways that are deeply transforming."</p> <p>Each chapter revolves around a central question related to knowing God on fresh terms: Is God a belief system? Is the Bible a landing strip or launching pad? Can what we're feeling inside be God? Are we too religiously minded to be any earthly good?</p> <p>Brian McLaren wrote, "I am tempted to say that Jim Palmer could well be the next Don Miller, but what they have in common, along with an honest spirituality and extraordinary skill as storytellers, is a unique voice."</p><p>The <em>Library Reviews</em> said of him, "Jim Palmer's casual, yet compelling writing style cuts through the religious rhetoric and gets to the real issues.readers will love this author! His sense of humor is alternately mixed with shocking sentences and poignant moments. Laced throughout is a refreshing honesty that ties his ideas together with a ribbon of reality.each turn of the page strips away a little more of the contrived mystery of Christianity until the simplicity and sincerity of it stands in realistic splendor."</p><p>More and more people seek a deeper spirituality beyond status-quo religion. Others are left empty and weary from a shallow and narrow pop-Christianity. Palmer says that God's kingdom of love, peace, and freedom can be a present reality in any person's life. He proclaims that God is indeed in the process of birthing something deep and wide among unlikely people in unconventional ways, which is changing the world...one "nobody" at a time. </p></p><p><br> <br><b>Jim Palmer</b> has a Master of Divinity degree and was a successful Senior Pastor before he left institutional church and organized religion to explore new dimensions of his relationship with God. Since 2005 he has been chronicling his journey beginning with Divine Nobodies: Shedding Religion to Find God (and the unlikely people who help you), and then Wide Open Spaces: Beyond Paint-by-Number Christianity. His most previous book is, Being Jesus in Nashville: Finding the Courage to Live Your Life (whoever and wherever you are).<br><br><br> After leaving church ministry Jim led&nbsp;a non-profit agency for at-risk kids, and later served as the U.S. Director of Education for International Justice Mission, an international human rights organization based in Washington, D.C. In addition to writing, Jim is an adjunct professor of religion and ethics. He offers spiritual direction and coaching, and leads non-religious spirituality retreats and workshops. His current focus is The Religion-Free Bible Project, an endeavor of recreating the Bible in a voice that is free from religious bias, and free to fully express its profound and inclusive message for all humankind.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jim and his family reside in Nashville, Tennessee.With <i>Divine Nobodies</i>, emerging church leader Palmer touched a nerve with readers who gravitate toward cutting-edge evangelical writers like Brian McLaren and Donald Miller. Similarly, this book employs a personal, homespun style to dissent from Christianity-as-usual. Palmer examines such spiritual disciplines as honing one's belief system in accordance with biblical principles; advancing the gospel outside of church walls; dismantling ineffective church practices; and discovering purpose in unexpected places. He might raise the hackles of some evangelicals with a confessional narrative of putting aside the Bible for a season, recognizing that it was at the center of ...a religion that had left [him] empty, exhausted, and disillusioned. Palmer shed this conventional religion as he purposefully tuned out preachers and others quoting or referring to it, and writes that the result was that God spoke to him through nature, people, art, film and music. Palmer might be termed a renegade, but most young evangelicals will see him as a rebel with a cause and a message worth considering. <i>(Dec. 4)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Greeks and Romans speculated about the Moon almost 2000 years before H.G. Wells or Jules Verne wrote about it, but interest peaked from the late 1800s, when the prospect of lunar travel became more viable. This anthology presents 11&nbsp;short stories from the most popular magazines of the golden age of SF, including <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, <i>Astounding Science Fiction</i>, and <i>Amazing Stories</i>, and features classic SF writers as well as lesser-known writers for dedicated fans of the genre to discover.</p><p><b>Mike Ashley </b>is the author and editor of more than 60 books, and is one of the foremost historians of popular fiction.&#x201c;Ashley delivers a robust collection of 12 short science fiction classics representing the era when the moon was the center of the fantastic literary imagination.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>The Mountain Poems of Meng Hao-Jan</h2><p>The first full flowering of Chinese poetry occurred in the illustrious T&#x2019;ang Dynasty, and at the beginning of this renaissance stands Meng Hao-jan (689-740 c.e.), esteemed elder to a long line of China&#x2019;s greatest poets. Deeply influenced by Ch&#x2019;an (Zen) Buddhism, Meng was the first to make poetry from the Ch&#x2019;an insight that deep understanding lies beyond words. The result was a strikingly distilled language that opened new inner depths, non-verbal insights, and outright enigma. This made Meng Hao-jan China&#x2019;s first master of the short imagistic landscape poem that came to typify ancient Chinese poetry. And as a lifelong intimacy with mountains dominates Meng&#x2019;s work, such innovative poetics made him a preeminent figure in the wilderness (literally rivers-and-mountains) tradition, and that tradition is the very heart of Chinese poetry.<br>This is the first English translation devoted to the work of Meng Hao-jan. Meng&#x2019;s poetic descendents revered the wisdom he cultivated as a mountain recluse, and now we too can witness the sagacity they considered almost indistinguishable from that of rivers and mountains themselves.</p><p>Meng Hao-jan (689-740 C.E.) is generally considered to be one of China&#x2019;s most important poets, but before now, there has never been an edition of his work in English. Ch&#x2019;an (Zen) Buddhism was coming to maturity and becoming widely practiced among the intelligentsia of China. Ch&#x2019;an not only clarified the spiritual ecology of early Taoist thought, it also emphasized the old Taoist idea that deep understanding lies beyond words. In poetry, this gave rise to a much more distilled language, especially in its concise imagism, which opened new inner depths, non-verbal insights, and outright enigma. It was in the work of Meng Hao-jan that this poetic revolution began, a revolution that marked the beginning of Chinese poetry&#x2019;s first great flowering. He opened the poetic ground that would be cultivated so productively by the great poets that followed, and he was revered by those poets as their esteemed elder, first master of the short imagistic landscape poem.<br>Translator: David Hinton&#x2019;s many translations of ancient Chinese poetry have earned wide acclaim for creating compelling contemporary poetry. He is also the first translator in more than a century to translate the four original masterworks of Chinese philosophy: Tao Te Ching, Chuang Tzu, Analects, Mencius. He has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship as well as numerous fellowships from the National Endowment of the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. In 1997 he received the Landon Translation Award from the Academy of American Poets.Autumn Begins<br><br>Autumn begins unnoticed.

Drawing from popular and trade magazines, floor plans and architectural drawings, television programs, advertisements, and beyond, Dianne Harris shows how the depiction of houses and their interiors, furnishings, and landscapes shaped and reinforced the ways in which Americans perceived white, middle-class identities and helped support a housing market already defined by racial segregation and deep economic inequalities.</p><p>After describing the ordinary postwar house and its orderly, prescribed layout, Harris analyzes how cultural iconography associated these houses with middle-class whites and an ideal of white domesticity. She traces how homeowners were urged to buy specific kinds of furniture and other domestic objects and how the appropriate storage and display of these possessions was linked to race and class by designers, tastemakers, and publishers. Harris also investigates lawns, fences, indoor-outdoor spaces, and other aspects of the postwar home and analyzes their contribution to the assumption that the rightful owners of ordinary houses were white.</p><p>Richly detailed, <i>Little White Houses</i> adds a new dimension to our understanding of race in America and the inequalities that persist in the U.S. housing market.<br><br></p></p><p><p>Dianne Harris is an architectural historian and director of the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. She is the author of <i>The Nature of Authority: Villa Culture, Landscape, and Representation in Eighteenth-Century Lombardy </i>and the editor of <i>Second Suburb: Levittown, Pennsylvania</i>, among other books. </p><p>"In this fascinating probe of the familiar suburban tract homes of the post&#x2013;World War II era, Dianne Harris powerfully conveys how race and class were inscribed on the new metropolitan landscape. White middle-class America was born and raised in suburbia, a legacy we still live with today."&#x2014;Lizabeth Cohen, author of<i> A Consumers&#x2019; Republic: The Politics of Mass Consumption in Postwar America</i></p><p>"Impressively interdisciplinary and marvelously attentive to telling details, intimate lives, and social structures, Dianne Harris joins Dolores Hayden, Gwendolyn Wright, and others in making the architecture and landscape of everyday lives illuminate the workings of an entire historical period. <i>Little White Houses</i> is a blockbuster contribution to the critical study of whiteness and to the history of the United States after World War II."&#x2014;David Roediger, author of <i>How Race Survived U.S. History: From Settlement and Slavery to the Obama Phenomenon</i></p><br><br><p>"Harris has contributed a major shift in perspective toward new and important ways to understand the history of postwar housing in the United States."&#x2014;<i>Antipode</i><br><br> "<i>Little White Houses</i> establishes a clearly articulated framework which future studies may be informed..., general readers and academics alike should take great interest in her provocative and groundbreaking book."&#x2014;<i>Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLiS/NA)</i><br><br> "Highly recommended."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br><br> "Harris&#x2019; book should motivate scholarly discussions and discourse for continued work toward creation of a more civil American society."&#x2014;<i>Journal of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences</i><br><br> "[Harris&#x2019;s] nuanced conception of the relationship between perceptions of racial identity, the federal systems of real estate financing, and the ways in which individual cultural choices defined the physical spaces associated with he single-family home is thoughtful and well-executed. However, the crucial correction to architectural histories that overlook the myriad roles race played in assumptions about design consistently marks the fundamental excellence of the text."&#x2014;<i>American Historical Review</i><br><br> "[Harris] powerfully conveys the idea that socially conditioned personal, family, and even national identities are fashioned as much from material and spatial configurations of the home as from explicit political and cultural beliefs."&#x2014;<i>Journal of Architectural Education</i><br><br> "<i>Little White Houses </i>is both lots of fun and incredibly valuable."&#x2014;<i>American Studies</i><br><br> "Harris&#x2019;s ingenuity in teasing out radical modern innovation, rapid historical change, and insidious ideological operations from the most mundane and familiar objects and arrangements is fascinating."&#x2014;<i>Traditional Dwellings &amp; Settlements Review</i><br><br> "<i>Little White Houses </i>offers an important contribution to the fields of suburban studies and whiteness studies, as well as to architectural history as a whole, providing a fresh look at the racial and classed dimensions of space and its representation and promotion during the postwar era."&#x2014;<i>Journal of American Studies</i><br><br> "Few scholars have so effectively drawn attention to the most unremarkable aspects of the built environment. Harris has produced a book that will be sure to engage readers and influence scholarship for many years to come."&#x2014;<i>Buildings &amp; Landscapes</i><br><br> "An excellent look into the crucial role the spaces of the home played in American identity formation and, more specifically, how those identities were strongly shaped by the narrow vision of home life in the postwar world."&#x2014;<i>H-Net Reviews</i></p></p><h2>Black Beauty (Dover Children&#39;s Thrift Classics)</h2><p>Perhaps the most celebrated animal story of the nineteenth century, <i>Black Beauty</i> is the suspenseful and deeply moving account of a horse's experiences at the hands of many owners &#x2014; some, sensitive riders who treated him gently; others, cruel drivers who thoughtlessly inflicted lasting damage.<br>Written as the animal's autobiography, and as an appeal for the humane treatment of horses, Anna Sewell's beloved classic reveals as much about human conduct and the social ills of the time as it does about the treatment of animals. Scenes from the lives of both the landed gentry and the impoverished working class offer a subtle but well-rounded perspective of social conditions in England during the late nineteenth century.<br>Animal lovers of all ages will cherish this memorable story, now available in this unabridged, modestly priced edition.</p><p>"A horse is a horse of course unless of course the horse is Black Beauty. Animal-loving children have been devoted to Black Beauty throughout this century, and no doubt will continue through the next. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints a clear picture of turn-of-the-century London, its message is universal and timeless: animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness.<p>Black Beauty tells the story of the horse's own long and varied life, from a well-born colt in a pleasant meadow to an elegant carriage horse for a gentleman to a painfully overworked cab horse. Throughout, Sewell rails--in a gentle, 19th-century way--against animal maltreatment. Young readers will follow Black Beauty's fortunes, good and bad, with gentle masters as well as cruel. Children can easily make the leap from horse-human relationships to human-human relationships, and begin to understand how their own consideration of others may be a benefit to all. (Ages 9 to 12)"</p>Black Beauty's tale, as told by himself, is the fascinating story of the life of a horse a hundred years ago, when horseswere a part of everyone's life.<p></p><p>Although his colthood and early life were happy, Black Beauty tastes the bitterness of cruel grooms and indifferent masters as he passes from hand to hand, progressing from the country to London and back again.</p><p></p><p>This, the most famous horse story ever written, is a must on everyone's reading list.</p></p><h2>Mystical Theology: The Science of Love</h2><p>From the earliest centuries there has existed a Christian theology of mysticism, defining the state which Bernard Lonergan called a "being in love with God." St. John of the Cross wrote such a theology for the sixteenth century, calling it "the science of love." Now, William Johnston, one of the great spiritual writers of our time, attempts to do the same for the twenty-first century.<p>In Part One of Mystical Theology Johnston surveys Christian mysticism through the centuries. Johnson shows that such a theology today must dialogue with modern science and with Eastern religions. Part Two provides this dialogue, where Johnston engages Einstein's theories as well as Zen Buddhism. In Part Three, it becomes clear how the "science of love" is no longer an esoteric discipline for monks and nuns. In Johnston's writing it becomes accessible to all modern people grappling with problems of sexuality, social justice, world peace, and the protection of the environment.</p><p>Mystical Theology is indispensable to all those seeking guidance as well as intellectual and historical foundations of the Christian mystical experience today.</p></p><p>One of the great contemporary writers on mysticism updates and renews mystical theology for modern Christians.William Johnston is Professor of Religious Studies and Director of the Institute of Oriental Religions of Sophia University. He has lectured on East-West mysticism in Europe and America.</p><h2>Badminton: Steps to Success (STS (Steps to Success Activity)</h2><p><p>Players clocking shuttlecocks at speeds of 200 miles per hour, new scoring rules, and nonstop action make badminton one of the fastest racket sports in the world.

Raniero Cantalamessa, preacher to the papal household, delves into the mystery of mercy, both human and divine. Jesus is &#34;the mercy of God who became flesh&#34;, and it is his gaze of mercy that transforms us. Among the Gospel passages he explores are Jesus encounters with Zacchaeus and the woman caught in adultery as well as the passion of Jesus, &#34;the height of God&#39;s mercy&#34;, and his resurrection, the &#34;triumph of God&#39;s mercy&#34;. He also reminds us that just as we are recipients of God&#39;s mercy, we are called to be merciful to others. Insightful and inspiring!</p><p>Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, OFM Cap, was born in Italy and ordained a Franciscan Capuchin priest in 1958. He taught at the Catholic University of Milan until 1979, when he resigned his teaching position to become a full-time preacher of the gospel. In 1980, he was appointed by Pope John Paul II as preacher to the papal household and still serves in that capacity. He is a frequent speaker at international and ecumenical conferences and rallies, and his books have been translated into more than twenty languages.</p><h2>Mirage Men</h2><p>This title is based on interviews with intelligence agents, scientists, psychics and UFO hunters who have been both victims and instigators of this saucer-shaped illusion.</p><p>Mark Pilkington is a writer, editor and filmmaker.

As the rug of reality is pulled repeatedly from under our feet, one thing becomes clear: the standard narrative, in which governments and the military are concealing the existence of extraterrestrials, is the opposite of the truth.

Porphyry's parents were Phoenician, and he was born Malchus ("king") in Tyre. His teacher in Athens, Cassius Longinus, gave him the name Porphyrius ("clad in purple"), a punning allusion to the color of the imperial robes. Under Longinus he studied grammar and rhetoric. In 262 he went to Rome, attracted by the reputation of Plotinus, and for six years devoted himself to the study of Neo-Platonism. <br> <br> He edited and published the Enneads, the only collection of the work of his teacher Plotinus. He also wrote many works himself on a wide variety of topics. His Isagoge, or Introduction, is an introduction to logic and philosophy, and in its Latin translation was the standard textbook on logic throughout the Middle Ages. In addition, through several of his works, most notably Philosophy from Oracles and Against the Christians, he was involved in a controversy with a number of early Christians, and his commentary on Euclid's Elements was used as a source by Pappus of Alexandria.</p><p></p><h2>Monkey (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Monkey depicts the adventures of Prince Tripitaka, a young Buddhist priest on a dangerous pilgrimage to India to retrieve sacred scriptures accompanied by his three unruly disciples: the greedy pig creature Pipsy, the river monster Sandy and Monkey. Hatched from a stone egg and given the secrets of heaven and earth, the irrepressible trickster Monkey can ride on the clouds, become invisible and transform into other shapes skills that prove very useful when the four travellers come up against the dragons, bandits, demons and evil wizards that threaten to prevent them in their quest. Wu Ch&#39;eng-en wrote Monkey in the mid-sixteenth century, adding his own distinctive style to an ancient Chinese legend, and in so doing created a dazzling combination of nonsense with profundity, slapstick comedy with spiritual wisdom.</p><p>Probably the most popular book in the history of the Far East, this classic combination of picaresque novel and folk epic mixes satire, allegory, and history into a rollicking tale. It is the story of the roguish Monkey and his encounters with major and minor spirits, gods, demigods, demons, ogres, monsters, and fairies.Very little is known about Wu Ch-eng-en (c. 1505-80) although he is believed to have held the post of District Magistrate for a time. He had a reputation as a good poet but only a few rather commonplace verses of his survive in an anthology of Ming poetry and in a local gazetteer.</p><h2>Gap Gardening: Selected Poems</h2><p><p><strong><strong>An essential edition of a major avant-garde poet: &#x201c;Waldrop compels us to seek out new superlatives&#x201d; (Ben Lerner, <em>Jacket</em>)</strong></strong></p><p>Rosmarie Waldrop says <em>Gap Gardening</em> &#x201c;spans forty years of exploring the language I breathe and move in and that continues to condition me even while I try to contribute to it.

How to Tell a Flatterer from ... in Virtue) (Loeb Classical Library No. 197)</h2><p><p>Plutarch (Plutarchus), ca. 45&#x2013;120 CE, was born at Chaeronea in Boeotia in central Greece, studied philosophy at Athens, and, after coming to Rome as a teacher in philosophy, was given consular rank by the emperor Trajan and a procuratorship in Greece by Hadrian. He was married and the father of one daughter and four sons. He appears as a man of kindly character and independent thought, studious and learned.</p><p>Plutarch wrote on many subjects. Most popular have always been the 46 <i>Parallel Lives</i>, biographies planned to be ethical examples in pairs (in each pair, one Greek figure and one similar Roman), though the last four lives are single. All are invaluable sources of our knowledge of the lives and characters of Greek and Roman statesmen, soldiers and orators. Plutarch's many other varied extant works, about 60 in number, are known as <i>Moralia</i> or Moral Essays. They are of high literary value, besides being of great use to people interested in philosophy, ethics and religion.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of the <i>Moralia</i> is in fifteen volumes, volume XIII having two parts.</p></p><p><p>Frank Cole Babbitt (1867&#x2013;1935) was the Hobart Professor of Greek Language and Literature at Trinity College, Hartford.</p>&#x201c;This miscellany of essays makes Plutarch the Montaigne or Hazlitt of antiquity. He is best known for his <i>Lives</i>, a series of parallel biographies of heroic exemplification describing the great men of Greece and Rome. But the <i>Moralia</i> are as rich, and even more diverse, containing much to instruct and entertain. Written in Greek during the course of Plutarch's life--he flourished about 100 CE--they had an enormous influence on western culture until a century or two ago. Some are classics in every sense of the word...This is agreeable and civilised stuff, refreshingly contemporaneous despite having been matured for two thousand years in the casks of literature.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>A.

Before he set off, he made a brief visit to Genoa, home of Christopher Columbus, where, in a local market, he found prickly pears, native to the Americas but now at home in the Old World: This sort of cross- fertilization of plants and seeds--as well as of cultures--is one of the author's subtexts here. Another is the need for ``rough country land where we can be truant and not have to pay to get in or be inspected on the way out.'' Nabhan discovered that little of such wilderness is left in Italy: The wolves have gone; the forests where chestnuts or truffles grow are planned; and even the ancient oaks at St. Francis's shrine, protected as artifacts rather than as living organisms, are dying from benign attention. Civilization is always close by, providing a mix of old and new: rock music and the waltz at an Umbrian corn festival (leading Nabhan to a brief history of corn in Italy, where it once caused pellagra among the peasants); farmers cultivating ancient native crops alongside New World imports like tomatoes and sunflowers; the tasting of the season's first truffles, dug up by dogs rather than by the traditional pigs. Throughout, Nabhan relates his experiences with a beguiling candor that's spoiled by only a few obvious thoughts and insights about human relationships. An enjoyable mix of information and opinion from a writer whose delight in nature is always wise and thoughtful, never sentimental or smug. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The crisis that followed almost triggered World War III. However, while all eyes were on the Caribbean, not all of the missiles were sent to Cuba. Several ships slipped from the flotilla and headed for a fishing village in a remote, frigid, northeastern Soviet frontier. There, a silo was constructed not far from Alaska.</p><p>More than sixty years later, that silo and its lethal contents are intact. Now, Iranian scientists team with a Russian agent and his estranged, arms-smuggling father to bring those missiles to Tehran. When an intel officer at Op Center starts picking up hints of the deal, the government&#x2019;s off-the-grid unit must track the unknown actors &#x2013; and try to decide whether they can count on data provided by an Iranian defector, a man who has more at stake than anyone realizes.</p><p>At the same time, Op-Center sends a lone agent to Havana to try and find an aging revolutionary, a woman, who may hold the key to pinpointing the location of the silo. </p><p>Complicating matters is a turf war between Op Center, the White House, and the FBI that threatens to compromise the investigation...as the time to act grows perilously short.</p></p><p><p>JEFF ROVIN is the author of more than 150 books, fiction and nonfiction, both under his own name, under various pseudonyms, or as a ghostwriter, including numerous <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers and over a dozen of the original Tom Clancy&#x2019;s Op-Center novels.</p><p>Jeff's books include <i>Conversations with the Devil</i> and <i>Tempest Down</i>.</p><p>"Rovin's thrilling fifth entry...all the elements seamlessly click into place and the book races to the finish.

He was cussed at, chased, shot at, and nearly run over. <i>More Poachers Caught!</i> is the follow-up to Tom&#x2019;s widely popular first book. It collects 30 new stories from throughout Tom&#x2019;s career and from a few of Tom&#x2019;s friends. Dangerous, spontaneous, and sometimes comedic, these true adventures bring readers face to face with the problem of poaching. They are tales of greed, selfishness, and hope. The short stories tell of some of the most memorable poachers who were ever caught by a Northwoods Game Warden&#x2015;and some who got away. Hunters, anglers, and outdoors enthusiasts of all ages will enjoy this fascinating book.</p></p><p>After earning a zoology degree in 1972, Tom Chapin spent most of his twenty-nine year career as a natural resource game warden in the Grand Rapids, Minnesota, district. Recently the author's campaigning and testimony prompted the Minnesota State Legislature to enact a gross over-limit law. Known as the &#x201c;Chapin Bill,&#x201d; this law increases penalties for violators who take large quantities of game and fish beyond legal limits. Now retired, Tom resides in Grand Rapids where he continues to teach and to promote ethical hunting and fishing.</p><h2>Just Imagine</h2><p><p>The War Between the States may be over for the rest of the country, but not for Kit Weston.

Sometimes wars of the heart can only be won through the sweetest of surrenders.</p></p><p>With the Civil War over, Kit Weston, a.k.a. Katherine Louise of Risen Glory Plantation, South Carolina, travels to New York disguised as a boy to eliminate her newly named guardian and regain control of her beloved plantation. Unfortunately for Kit, Baron Cain proves difficult to kill, and when he discovers her identity, Baron promptly stashes her in a New York finishing school for young ladies. <p> Three years later, Kit returns to Risen Glory to find that Baron has restored the plantation to its former prosperity. Baron scarcely recognizes the hoyden he remembers in the mature, 21-year-old Kit. The instant passion that flares between them is unwanted by both and equally undeniable. Pushed to the edge, Baron threatens to banish Kit from her beloved plantation, and she commits an impulsive, nearly unforgivable act. Baron's response is equally impossible and thrusts the pair into an intolerable situation. Wild and willful, passionate and wary, the two lovers must somehow find a way to overcome pride and distrust before there can be any likelihood of a loving resolution. </p><p> Readers who love Phillips's highly successful contemporary romances will be just as enthralled with this historical romance. Lush landscapes, complex characters, a charming cast of secondary players, and a subplot that takes a look at the effects of slavery and racist attitudes in the Old South all add up to an excellent novel.

For the human colonists settling the Amarantin homeworld Resurgam, it&#39;s of little more than academic interest. But Dan Sylveste will stop at nothing to get at the truth.</p><p>Alastair Reynolds's first novel is "hard" SF on an epic scale, crammed with technological marvels and immensities. Its events take place over a relatively short period, but have roots a billion years old--when the Dawn War ravaged our galaxy.<p> Sylveste is the only man ever to return alive and sane from a Shroud, an enclave in space protected by awesome gravity-warping defenses: "a folding a billion times less severe should have required more energy than was stored in the entire rest-mass of the galaxy." Now an intuition he doesn't understand makes him explore the dead world Resurgam, whose birdlike natives long ago tripped some booby trap that made their own sun erupt in a deadly flare.</p><p> Meanwhile, the vast, decaying lightship <i>Nostalgia for Infinity</i> is coming for Sylveste, whose dead father (in AI simulation) could perhaps help the Captain, frozen near absolute zero yet still suffering monstrous transformation by nanotech plague. Most of <i>Infinity</i>'s tiny crew have hidden agendas--Khouri the reluctant contract assassin believes she must kill Sylveste to save humanity--and there are two bodiless stowaways, one no longer human and one never human. Shocking truths emerge from bluff, betrayal, and ingenious lies.</p><p> The trail leads to a neutron star where an orbiting alien construct has defenses to challenge the Infinity's planet-wrecking superweapons.</p><p> At the heart of this artifact, the final revelations detonate--most satisfyingly. Dense with information and incident, this longish novel has no surplus fat and seems almost too short. A sparkling SF debut. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Alastair Reynolds was born in Barry, South Wales, in 1966.

Isabelle, who campaigns for natural wine around the world and runs the hugely successful RAW wine fairs in New York, London, and Berlin, reveals why the finest, most authentic wines are those made naturally. While currently not regulated by an official definition, natural wines are made from sustainably farmed, organic (or biodynamic) grapes, with nothing removed or added during winemaking, bar at most a dash of sulfites. It is good old-fashioned grape juice fermented into wine&#x2014;just as nature intended. If you care about what&#x2019;s in your glass, want to explore unique flavors, or are keen to support small-scale producers, then you need to know more about natural wine, and where to find it. The second edition of this consumer guide to natural wine has been fully updated, and explains the processes involved, introduces you to some of the growers, and suggests over 140 of the best wines for you to try.<br> <br>&#x201c;A joyous celebration of all that Legeron believes is good and pure in the world of wine and wine production.&#x201d; <i>TLS</i><br> <br>Shortlisted for the Andr� Simon Food &amp; Drink Awards 2015. the Fortnum and Mason Food &amp; Drink Awards 2014, and the Louis Roederer International Wine Writers Awards 2015.</p><p><p>Find out more about natural wine&#x2015;made naturally from organically or biodynamically grown grapes&#x2015;from leading authority Isabelle Legeron MW.</p>Isabelle Legeron MW is a crusader for the natural wine movement.

Authors Thea Burns and Philippe Saunier, both leading experts on the subject, shed new light on the acknowledged masters of the pastel, such as Maurice Quentin de la Tour and Jean-Etienne Liotard, who used these magical sticks of color to capture the character of their sitters; Edgar Degas and Mary Cassat, who used them to reveal the unexpected beauties of the everyday; and Odilon Redon, who used them to explore the inner mysteries of the spirit. But Burns and Saunier consider the pastel work of many other artists as well, from forgotten&#x2014;yet pleasing&#x2014;society portraitists to such important names as Delacroix, Whistler, and Picasso.<br> <br> As a rare achievement, their graceful yet authoritative text is matched by the color plates in this volume, which reproduce the harmoniously blended hues of more than 330 choice pastels, from collections around the world. For reasons of conservation, most of these works are exhibited only rarely, and then only in low light. Now they can be admired all together, without interruption, in this museum between two covers.<br> <br> A delight for the eyes as well as an important work of art history, <i>The Art of the Pastel</i> will be eagerly welcomed by artists, scholars, and art lovers alike.<br></p><p><br>"...this work is essential for anyone interested in the history and beauty of pastels." -- <i>Library Journal</i></p><h2>Seek That Which Is Above</h2><p>In this beautifully illustrated book, Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) gives us profound meditations on what our life in Christ should be like as it is lived through the various Seasons and Feasts of the liturgical year. This book also includes thoughts on other spiritual and secular themes such as the true nature of peace, why it is difficult for so many to experience joy, the relationship between spirit and matter, vacation and rest, etc. These inspiring insights from the man who became Pope, show how Joseph Ratzinger&#x2019;s deeply spiritual and theological experience, together with his wide literary and cultural interests are a gift to the Church in the modern world.

Celice and Joseph, in their mid-50s and married for more than 30 years, are returning to the seacoast where they met as students. They are reliving their first amorous encounter in the sand dunes when they are set upon by the murderer who beats them to death with a rock and steals their watches, their jewelry, and even their meager lunch. From that moment forward, this remarkably written book by Jim Crace becomes less about murder and more about death. Alternating chapters move back in time from the murder in hourly and two-hourly increments. As the narrative moves backward, we see Celice and Joseph make the small decisions about their day that will lead them inexorably towards their own deaths. Eventually we learn about their first meeting, and that this is not the first time tragedy has struck them in this idyllic setting. <p> In other chapters the narrative moves forward. Celice and Joseph are on vacation and nobody misses them until they do not return. Thus, it is six days before their bodies are found. Crace describes in minute detail their gradual return to the land with the help of crabs, birds, and the numerous insects that attack the body and gently and not so gently prepare it for the dust-to-dust phase of death. Celice and Joseph would have been delighted with the description: she was a zoologist and he was an oceanographer, and they spent their lives with their eyes to the microscope, observing the phenomena of life and death. Some readers might find this gruesome, but the facts of death are told in such glorious prose that these descriptions in no way detract from the enjoyment of the book. </p><p> After her parents do not return home, their daughter, Syl, must search the morgues and follow up John and Jane Doe reports until she is finally asked to make an identification of the remains in the dunes. We then discover that the reader has had a more intimate relationship with them in death than Syl ever had with them in life.

Herein is a history that is truthful, concise, yet comprehensive, written especially for students of middle school and high school age and for the parents who provide guidance through the home school educational approach. The 40 student lessons in this book present 278 years of our history: from the founding of Jamestown, Virginia Colony to the restoration of a healthy balance in American politics as evidenced by the election of Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1885. Each lesson (or chapter) includes suggestions for student discussion and lists a few resources for further study. The history of how Patriots of the Southern Colonies were instrumental in winning our American Revolution and creating our original limited-power federal government is covered. The history of how pioneers of the Southern Culture spearheaded the western migration to the Mississippi and beyond is covered. Our Civil War, also known as The War Between the States, was the major event in those 278 years of our history. For that reason, the political sectionalism that tore the country apart is presented in detail. The war itself is covered, but only one chapter reviews major battles. The subsequent Political Reconstruction is covered in detail, with ample explanation of how the principle of State Rights, previously treasured in both the North and the South, was subjugated under a far more powerful Federal Government following the conquest of the Confederate States. The Society of Independent Southern Historians is a nonprofit educational organization registered in North Carolina and composed of Members all across America. Some Members are school teachers and college professors, but most have, instead, pursued careers in other fields. Many are retired. All have a passion for the truthful telling of history and have, collectively, acquired an extensive knowledge of Southern history, literature, biography, culture, etc. Our interests range from the settlement of Jamestown, Virginia Colony, in 1607 to just prior to World War II.

Its depiction of the nightmarish journey of the unskilled laborer Hilarion and his wife from the slums of Port-au-Prince to the cane fields of the Dominican Republic has brought comparisons to the work of Emile Zola, Andr� Malraux, Richard Wright, and Ernest Hemingway.</p><p>Alexis, whose mother was a descendant of the Revolutionary General Jean-Jacques Dessalines, was already a mature thinker when he published General Sun, My Brother (Comp�re G�n�ral Soleil) in France in 1955. A militant Marxist himself, Alexis championed a form of the "marvelous realism" developed by the Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier, who called for a vision of historical reality from the standpoint of slaves for whom the supernatural was as much a part of everyday experience as were social and other existential realities.</p><p> <i>General Sun, My Brother </i>opens as Hilarion is arrested for stealing a wallet and imprisoned with an activist named Pierre Roumel&#x2015;a fictional double for the novelist Jacques Roumain&#x2015;who schools him in the Marxist view of history. On his release, Hilarion meets Claire-Heureuse and they settle down together. Hilarion labors in sisal processing and mahogany polishing while his partner sets up a small grocery store. After losing everything in a criminally set fire, the couple joins the desperate emigration to the Dominican Republic. Hilarion finds work as a sugarcane cutter, but the workers soon become embroiled in a strike that ends in the "Dominican Vespers," the 1937 massacre pf Haitian workers by the Dominican army. The novel personifies the sun as the ally, brother, and leader of the peasants. Mortally wounded in crossing the Massacre River back into Haiti, Hilarion urges Claire-Heureuse to remarry and to continue to work for a Haiti where people can live in dignity and peace.</p></p><p>From Reviews of the French Edition: <p>"All of Jacques Stephen Alexis's tableaux come together to make [of his narrative] an astonishingly humane and true-to-life book in which the psychological detail and the emotional content go beyond literary subtleties."<br> --Magloire Saint-Aude, <i>Optique</i> </p><p>"This black man who writes in French weaves his language from inherited words and rhythms. A timeless Africa, a more recent Spain, a strong Caribbean tradition, and several North American sites have taken root in the language of Racine and Rimbaud."<br> --Gabriel Venaisssin, <i>Temoignage Chretien</i></p><p>Jacques Stephen Alexis had already gained international recognition for his fiction when he returned to Haiti from Cuba in 1961 as part of a small invasion force.

Over time, though, the challenges of life constrain that flow, leaving us unbalanced. We often find ourselves stuck in inertia, exhausted by overdoing, or strained and preoccupied with trying to control everything. Roaming Free Inside the Cage will help you identify your unique pattern of imbalance and reclaim your inborn freedom so that you can move forward with clarity of vision, confidence in your own power, and composure in the face of life&#39;s adversities. &#34;There is much to digest and absorb here, principles and practices, history, symbolism, and poetic expression. This work requires only the caution that, as in much that is written about the Enneagram, we are dealing with subjective internal experience rather than objective external measurement. This is a book on experience of, rather than knowledge about. Come to it with a willingness to use the principles of optimal learning, be receptive and grounded in order to open your heart and mind with curiosity, and have the expectation of benefit.

In this compact book, world-renowned spiritual teacher Rav DovBer Pinson presents 32 key concepts of Kabbalah and shows their value in opening the gates of perception. <br><br>From the Introduction: Simply translated, Kabbalah means "that which is received." Looking deeper, the word Kabbalah can mean to be open and receptive, to challenge one's own internal navigational system in order to see, hear, and be open to... more. We must be receptive to a teaching to fully absorb it. We turn ourselves into vessels and invite within that which we wish to understand or grasp. In this way, we become receptacles, dispensaries, and a part of the Kabbalah. We become vessels of this tradition by opening the self to a higher reality, and viewing the spirit within the matter. We raise our consciousness to the point where the Divine within all creation is revealed. As we pursue a deeper awareness, we become less ego-centered and more attuned to the deeper significance of our surroundings.</p><p>Rav DovBer Pinson is a world-renowned scholar, author, Kabbalist, and beloved spiritual teacher, a master of the revealed and hidden aspects of Torah.<br><br>He is widely recognized as one of the leading authorities on authentic Kabbalah and Jewish spirituality.<br><br>Through his books, lectures, and counsel he has touched and inspired the lives of tens of thousands the world over. He is an internationally acclaimed speaker and has lectured in both scholarly and lay settings throughout the globe.<br><br>Rav DovBer Pinson is the Rosh Yeshiva of the IYYUN Yeshiva and heads the IYYUN Center in Brownstone Brooklyn.</p><h2>Fairy Tales: Brothers Grimm; Illustrated by Arthur Rackham (Everyman&#39;s Library Children&#39;s Classics Series)</h2><p>Hansel and Gretel, Rumpelstiltskin, and Snow White are among the jewels we owe to the German brothers Grimm, who began in the first decade of the 19th century to seek out and listen to village storytellers. The best-loved of the tales they discovered are now brought together with the marvelous pictures that in 1900 first established the reputation of one of the greatest children&#39;s illustrators of all time, Arthur Rackham.</p><p><b>The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859)</b>, were born in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout their lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg University. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology, and although Wilhelm's work was hampered by poor health the brothers collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until a century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known for the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral sources and published in two volumes of 'Nursery and Household Tales' in 1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as part of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was first published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon came into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar Taylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about fifty stories 'with the amusement of some young friends principally in view'. They have been an essential ingredient of children's reading ever since.British actress Laura Paton reads fairy tales, including &#34;The Frog Prince,&#34; &#34;The Elves and the Shoemaker,&#34; &#34;Hansel and Gretel,&#34; &#34;Little Red Riding Hood&#34; and &#34;Cinderella.&#34; Paton reads at a comfortable pace in a clear, versatile voice. She gives a quiet, deft reading without intrusive overdramatization, which allows listeners to become involved in the stories. The stories are introduced with brief musical passages taken from Tchaikovsky, Strauss and Grieg, which enhance the presentation. Whether listeners know these classic stories well or are hearing them from the first time, they&#39;ll enjoy this collection. C.R.A.

Reed, an expert in biblical archaeology, reveal through archaeology and textual scholarship that Paul, like Jesus, focused on championing the Kingdom of God&#x2013;&#x2013;a realm of justice and equality&#x2013;&#x2013;against the dominant, worldly powers of the Roman empire. </p><p> Many theories exist about who Paul was, what he believed, and what role he played in the origins of Christianity. Using archaeological and textual evidence, and taking advantage of recent major discoveries in Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Syria, Crossan and Reed show that Paul was a fallible but dedicated successor to Jesus, carrying on Jesus's mission of inaugurating the Kingdom of God on earth in opposition to the reign of Rome. Against the concrete backdrop of first&#x2013;century Grego&#x2013;Roman and Jewish life, In Search of Paul reveals the work of Paul as never before, showing how and why the liberating messages and practices of equality, caring for the poor, and a just society under God's rules, not Rome's, were so appealing.</p><p> Readers interested in Paul as a historical figure and his place in the development of Christianity</p><p> <br> �Readers interested in archaeology and anthropology</p></p><p><p>John Dominic Crossan, professor emeritus at DePaul University, is widely regarded as the foremost historical Jesus scholar of our time. He is the author of several bestselling books, including <em>The Historical Jesus</em>, <em>How to Read the Bible and Still Be a Christian, God and Empire</em>, <em>Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography</em>, <em>The Greatest Prayer, The Last Week, </em>and <em>The Power of Parable</em>. He lives in Minneola, Florida.</p><br><br><p>Jonathan L Reed is a leading authority on the archaeology of early Christianity and has excavated in Galilee since 1987. He has conducted research at the Albright Institute for Archaeological Research in Jerusalem, the American Academy in Rome, and the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. He is author of <em>Archaeology and the Galilean Jesus</em> and has co-authored with John Dominic Crossan two bestselling books, <em>Excavating Jesus</em> and <em>In Search of Paul</em>. He is professor of New Testament at the University of La Verne and is on the research council of Claremont Graduate University's world-renowned Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, where he is directing their Galilean Archaeology and the Historical Jesus project.</p>Crossan and Reed make a compelling case for the idea that culture, politics and quest for empire played as large a part in the formation of the Apostle Paul as did theology and religious training. It is an approach that will leave some wondering just how much of a role spirituality played in the Paul story. The authors (Crossan is a prolific author and former co-chair of the Jesus Seminar, Reed is Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at La Verne College in California) dig deeply into the history and archeology of Paul's world, searching for an understanding of the enigmatic apostle. Paul emerges as a fervent advocate for both the uniqueness of the Christian faith and the marginalization of others, the triumph of the City of God over the pagan and anti-God Roman empire. And this Paul is willing to reach out to both Jew and Gentile to accomplish his aims. In the end, Paul the man of faith is subsumed in Paul the agenda-driven revolutionary. The authors' masterful use of history, geography and theology combine to offer a strong case for their thesis. This book is written for a sophisticated audience, and therefore will be inaccessible to many readers, but it will be a valuable addition to the scholar's library. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The author, an anthropologist, devotes separate chapters to:� sacrifice (both animal and human); � self-mortification (including self-injury, asceticism, and martyrdom); � religious persecution (from anti-Semitic pogroms to witchhunts); � ethno-religious conflict (including such hotspots as Sri Lanka, Northern Ireland, and the former Yugoslavia); � religious wars (from the ancient Hebrews&#39; wars and the Christian Crusades to Islamic jihad and Hindu righteous wars); � and religious homicide and abuse (spousal abuse, genital mutilation, and &#34;dowry death,&#34; among other manifestations). In the final chapter, &#34;Religion and Nonviolence,&#34; the author examines nonviolent and low-conflict societies and considers various methods of managing conflict. This book goes a long way toward helping us understand the nature of violence generally, its complicated connections with religion, and how society in the future might avoid being blindsided by the worst aspects of human nature.</p><p><b>Jack David Eller, PhD</b> (Denver, CO), is the author of six other books, including <i>Cultural Anthropology: Global Forces, Local Lives</i> and <i>Introducing Anthropology of Religion: Culture to the Ultimate</i>. He is an assistant professor of anthropology at the Community College of Denver and the film editor for the Anthropology Review Database.Over the centuries, critics of religion have often condemned the world's religions because of the violent acts religions' practitioners have committed against society and against one another. In this unremarkable study of religious violence, anthropologist Eller simply reminds us that religion and violence are not synonymous. After he explores quite perfunctorily six dimensions of violence (instinct, integration into groups, identity, institutions, interests, and ideology), he contends that religion is a social and ideological system that creates a reality in which violence is acceptable, necessary, and even desirable. Drawing on a broad range of examples from the world's religions, Eller examines the violence of many religious practices, ranging from sacrifice and asceticism to war and ethnoreligious conflict. In spite of the persistence of violent acts in and by religions, many religious traditions teach and practice nonviolence, and in his concluding chapter Eller explores the ways in which such traditions present an alternative to religious violence. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Known for sharp imagery, startling metaphors and deceptively simple diction, his luminous poems offer mysterious glimpses into the deepest facets of humanity, often through the lens of the natural world. These new translations by Patty Crane, presented side by side with the original Swedish, are tautly rendered and elegantly cadenced. They are also deeply informed by Crane&#x2019;s personal relationship with the poet and his wife during the years she lived in Sweden, where she was afforded greater insight into the nuances of his poetics and the man himself.</p><p>Tomas G�sta Transtr�mer: Transtr�mer is a Swedish writer, poet and translator, whose poetry has been translated into over 60 languages. He's acclaimed as one of the most important European writers since World War II and was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Literature. He died March 26, 2015 at the age of 83.<br>Patty Crane: Patty Crane&#x2019;s translations of Tomas Transtr�mer&#x2019;s poetry have appeared in American Poetry Review, Blackbird, New Ohio Review, Poetry Daily, Poetry East, and Smartish Pace. She spent three years living in the Stockholm area of Sweden, where she worked closely with Transtr�mer and his wife, Monica.<b>A <i>New York Times Book Review</i> Editors' Choice</b><br><b>A <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Fabulous Holiday Book</b><br>"Crane&#x2019;s verse sounds good in English, and it comes with facing-page Swedish....

It has been translated into English many times since 1785, and has had a profound influence in America, beginning with the transcendentalists and continuing today. It is taught in introductory world literature, religion, and Eastern religion courses, and is often prescribed in yoga teacher training courses because it explains the core principles of Vedic philosophy, which are central to yoga practice.</p><p>Some of the currently available translations are in verse and, while well crafted, often do not accurately reflect the forms, sounds, and rhythms of the original. Older scholarly translations convey little feel for language. George Thompson's intention is to be as accurate and engaging as possible, and to create a translation that has scholarly bona fides, literary sensibility, and greater accuracy than previous translations. He emphasizes the social, historical, literary, and philosophical contexts surrounding the text. His introduction explains the development of Hindu thought and where the philosophy of the "Gita" fits historically, along with a history of the text and its place in Indian literature and philosophy and history..</p></p><p><p><b>George Thompson</b>, a Vedic scholar and Sanskritist, has more than twenty years of experience teaching the Bhagavad Gita at college level. He is an assistant professor at Montserrat College of Art in Beverly, Massachusetts.</p><p>&#x201c;This new translation of the Bhagavad Gita comes as close to the liveliness, topicality, and flow of the original as any I have seen. Professor George Thomson has more than twenty years of experience teaching it to students. His Introduction explains the Yoga of the Gita. It is learned without being heavy. Notes and bibliography are helpful and succinct. I recommend this translation without reservation to scholars and teachers of Sanskrit and to beginning students of Indian culture. It remains the most popular book of one of the largest and most creative civilizations of the contemporary world.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Frits Staal, Professor Emeritus, University of California at Berkeley</i></p><p>&#x201c;The Bhagavad Gita is and has always been a must read for anyone interested in India, ancient or modern. No wonder it has been translated and re-translated into so many languages, English being perhaps the most frequently used medium. Dr. Thompson's translation is truly novel, because not only does it render the poem's Sanskrit quite differently, but also offers groundbreaking interpretations of many stanzas, even well-known ones. It retains poetic qualities of the original and is a genuine pleasure to read. Moreover, it fully meets expectations that even the most demanding readers of our time have come to count on in an academic translation: it is precise and thoroughly researched. The translation and commentary testify to the author's ample erudition. Compelling comments will no doubt be of great service to inquisitive minds who would want to understand the author's approach to translating some of the most difficult Sanskrit passages that are rendered masterfully. I wholeheartedly recommend this translation to all readers.&#x201d; &#x2015;Boris Oguibenine, Professor, Universit� Marc Bloch de Strasbourg</p><p>&#x201c;George Thompson brings his fine-tuned sense of poetic language and his deep knowledge of the Indian, especially Vedic, religious tradition to this fresh and vigorous new translation of this foundational text.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Stephanie W. Jamison, Professor of Asian Languages and Cultures, UCLA</i></p><p>&#x201c;With this elegant, new rendering of The Bhagavad Gita, George Thompson has achieved the seemingly impossible: his translation is accurate, yet readable; written in crisp, straightforward prose, but filled with poetic brilliance; accompanied by a learned introduction and valuable commentary, both of which are informed by profound Indological scholarship that illuminates rather than intimidates. In short, this is a gem that will be appreciated by anyone who wishes to familiarize himself or herself with one of the world's greatest religious and philosophical classics. It will be of particular interest to those who are studying or practicing Yoga, but will also be warmly welcomed by anyone who wishes to learn more about traditional Indian culture and thought.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Victor H. Mair, Professor of Chinese Language and Literature Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, University of Pennsylvania</i></p><p>&#x201c;The Bhagavad Gita has been used in numerous ways from Gandhi to proponents of nuclear war. The central issue is one of belief strong enough to override any other consideration, including one's own death. George Thompson's translation is clear and luminous; it opens a space of engagement that other translations often miss. I was able to read and think about the Gita as a contemporary text, one arguing in relation to our concerns as well as those of ancient Hinduism. Thompson's introduction brings out both the background of the Gita and its current relevance. His translation presents the philosophical/ethical issues that underly it and brings the Gita to life and to relevance both as historic document and contemporary discourse. This version seems lucid and true and wonderful; everyone should read it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alan Sondheim, West Virginia University, Center for Literary Computing</i></p><p>&#x201c;George Thompson's new translation of <i>The Bhagavad Gita</i> is a gift to teachers, students and seekers. The prose is lucid, lively and admirably literal. The key metaphors are skillfully rendered, the core teachings precisely delineated; most important, the philosophical and spiritual radiance of the original shines through.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Carol Zaleski, Professor of World Religions, Smith College</i></p></p><h2>The Best Science Fiction of the Year: Volume Three</h2><p>As Earth dies, an architect is commissioned to remote build a monument on Mars from the remains of a failed colony; a man who has transferred his consciousness into a humanoid robot discovers he&#x2019;s missing thirty percent of his memories, and tries to discover why; bored with life in the underground colony of an alien world, a few risk life inside one of the &#x201c;whales&#x201d; floating in the planet&#x2019;s atmosphere; an apprentice librarian searching through centuries of SETI messages from alien civilizations makes an ominous discovery; a ship in crisis pulls a veteran multibot out from storage with an unusual assignment: pest control; the dead are given a second shot at life, in exchange for a five-year term in a zombie military program.

P. Lovecraft and pop culture, in the vein of It and Stranger Things. An exuberant and wickedly entertaining celebration of horror, love, friendship, and many-tentacled, interdimensional demon spawn. SUMMER 1977. The Blyton Summer Detective Club (of Blyton Hills, a small mining town in Oregon&#39;s Zoinx River Valley) solved their final mystery and unmasked the elusive Sleepy Lake monster-another low-life fortune hunter trying to get his dirty hands on the legendary riches hidden in Deboen Mansion. And he would have gotten away with it too, if it weren&#39;t for those meddling kids. 1990. The former detectives have grown up and apart, each haunted by disturbing memories of their final night in the old haunted house. There are too many strange, half-remembered encounters and events that cannot be dismissed or explained away by a guy in a mask. And Andy, the once intrepid tomboy now wanted in two states, is tired of running from her demons. She needs answers. To find them she will need Kerri, the one-time kid genius and budding biologist, now drinking her ghosts away in New York with Tim, an excitable Weimaraner descended from the original canine member of the club. They will also have to get Nate, the horror nerd currently residing in an asylum in Arkham, Massachusetts. Luckily Nate has not lost contact with Peter, the handsome jock turned movie star who was once their team leader... which is remarkable, considering Peter has been dead for years. The time has come to get the team back together, face their fears, and find out what actually happened all those years ago at Sleepy Lake. It&#39;s their only chance to end the nightmares and, perhaps, save the world.</p><p>Edgar Cantero is a writer and cartoonist from Barcelona who works in Catalan, Spanish, and English.

Then you know you will never wake up in time, you will not make it to the end of this paragraph alive. Desperate reassuring thoughts try to rise over the panic in your head: it&#x2019;s okay, you don&#x2019;t need lights, you are practically awake already. You are lying on your bed, you can guess the familiar shape of the side lamp in the morning twilight and hear the old radiator clunking in the night; you are safe. It&#x2019;s just that the lamp doesn&#x2019;t work. But you want it to work; you need to dispel the darkness and let certainty outline the room so the things outside know you&#x2019;re awake and won&#x2019;t dare enter, and you pull the chain again and again, and you recall the lamp switch has failed before (has it?), and look, the lightbulb really is trying, though it barely manages to seep a wan glow, and it&#x2019;s not enough to flash the room out of the shadows, but who needs more, the lamp says, you&#x2019;re here, this is your room, I am your lamp, that&#x2019;s your radiator going <i>clunk </i>in the night, that&#x2019;s the same old closed door beyond which things might lurk and breathe skinless and eyeless, but you can rest, we promise we don&#x2019;t exist really, lie down. Or are you lying down? Because you think you&#x2019;re up on your elbows, but your arms aren&#x2019;t feeling the weight now that you focus on them; in fact, your eyeballs are not moving, and then you try to say &#x201c;hey&#x201d; but your throat isn&#x2019;t responding either, so you cling to the sheets (Do you? Are your fingernails truly scratching the linen?) and you struggle to emit a sound, make your vocal cords vibrate, push some air through your windpipe, just feel your fucking windpipe, for God&#x2019;s sake, shout and wake up the slumbering blob that is you on your bed, sleeping, dreaming, at the mercy of drooling things outside the closed door, and you pull pull pull pull pull the chain and the lamp insists, I can&#x2019;t, it&#x2019;s a technical fault, but I promise you you&#x2019;re awake, look at me, I&#x2019;m your good old lamp, I&#x2019;ve never lied to you, the chain has failed before, you know this, you should install a real switch you can snap on and off, and that&#x2019;s when you realize your bedside lamp never had a chain. Furthermore, there&#x2019;s no radiator in the room that can go <i>clunk. </i>It&#x2019;s their footsteps <i>(clunk), </i>and the door is already open&#x2014;try to shout&#x2014;they&#x2019;re in your room&#x2014;try to shout&#x2014;they&#x2019;re creeping up your bed <i>(clunk), </i>stretching toward you <i>(clunk), </i>squamous ice-cold webbed fingers aiming for your spine&#x2014;try to SHOUT!<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her own scream woke her up. It probably woke the whole block, really. She could still hear it resonating in the shoebox width of the room while her racing heart geared down from sprint to marathon and senses swept her surroundings, checking up on reality (of course this is your room, you dimwit, look at how cold and smelly and dampened by bureaucratic rain-pattering and faraway sirens it is). It had not been a bad scream, Kerri judged by the echoes of it. Not so much an <i>eeek, a mouse </i>kind of shrill as a strong, hard-boiled <i>holy mother of fuck.</i><br><br>Tim&#x2019;s grave, silent stare seemed to confirm it: On really bad nights she would wake up to the dog on the bed, barking away the night�mares. Today he was just sitting by, eyes level and fixed on her, an <i>At ease, soldier </i>expression on his face.<br><br>She sat up in her unheated room, lit by the TV static sky, and touched the ice-cold window glass. Real sensations, all of them. She wondered how dreams managed to deceive her every time; they were so blatantly dreams in retrospect, the fake stimuli so dim and shallow.

It was all too complex to be fabricated.<br><br>&#x201c;How do you stay sane, Tim?&#x201d; she asked him.<br><br>Tim whimpered, olivertwisting his pale blue eyes.<br><br>Kerri gave him a flirt-acknowledging smirk and allowed him to hop inside the spartan cast-iron-framed bed. She sat against the wall, flipped through the dozen books on the solitary shelf, opened one paperback, and retrieved the newspaper clip.<br><br>The teen sleuths grinned back at her across thirteen years, from the sunny grayscale shores of Sleepy Lake, 1977.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you still see them?&#x201d; asked the shrink.<br><br>Nate, crash-landed on the armchair opposite, threw back a dehy�drated stare.<br><br>&#x201c;Your friends, I mean,&#x201d; Dr. Willett clarified. &#x201c;Are you still in contact with them?&#x201d;<br><br>Nate took a drag of his cigarette clutched between Band-Aid-wrapped fingertips, stalling for the end of the session.<br><br>&#x201c;My cousin Kerri calls from time to time. She went to study biology in New York, and she stayed there. I see her once or twice a year. Her mom still breeds Weimaraners back in Portland.<br><br>&#x201c;Andy just left. At sixteen or so, she threw a backpack over her shoulder, left home, and jumped on a train to . . . I don&#x2019;t know, find herself or whatever. She was always the complex one.

It was March, but still winter. That&#x2019;s what the last thirteen years had been: a very long winter. <br><br>&#x201c;Nah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We were kids. Childhood friends don&#x2019;t last forever. I mean, who holds on to the past for that long?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Thomas X. Wickley&#x2019;s own thirteen-year-old copy of the <i>Pennaquick Telegraph, </i>stained with blood and urine, burned inside his breast pocket during the parole hearing.<br><br>&#x201c;You were charged with fraud, attempted burglary, kidnapping, and child endangerment. And you pleaded guilty to all four. Is that correct?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it is.&#x201d;<br><br>Thirteen years.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, you know kidnapping is the most serious of these charges. And yet it&#x2019;s also the one for which you could have more easily pleaded innocence. You were aware that this crime in itself, kidnapping a minor, added ten years to your sentence?&#x201d;<br><br>Thirteen fucking years.<br><br>&#x201c;I was,&#x201d; he answered.<br><br>His hands on the table didn&#x2019;t even shudder at the number. They stayed still and gnarled like ancient trees, mumbling in grumpy voices, <i>Thirteen years, you say, boy? That&#x2019;s nothing!</i><br><br>It was true. He never had any plans for those thirteen years anyway. Not since things went awry in Blyton Hills.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Wickley? I was asking, would you mind retelling for us the circumstances of that charge?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; he said, in the tone both weary and secretly glad to be asked of every old man who has a chance to tell a story, no matter how embarrassing. &#x201c;My . . . perceived rivals at the time were teenagers. Children. During that night at the house on the lake, they split up to cover more ground. I saw the chance to seize one and I did. She&#x2019;d acci�dentally fallen through a trapdoor and I found her in the basement. I gagged her and tied her up. I didn&#x2019;t even consider she was only a little girl. I was blinded by greed. I am no danger to those children anymore. I don&#x2019;t hate children.&#x201d;<br><br>He stopped well before being carried away into saying he liked children. Words must be picked carefully in a parole hearing. <br><br>&#x201c;You are aware, of course,&#x201d; the commissioner said, &#x201c;that those kids are no longer children.&#x201d;<br><br>They giggled. The kids in the picture did, with their shiny hair and bucktoothed smiles. He heard them through the breast pocket of his orange jumpsuit.<br><br>He scoffed out of the gaffe: &#x201c;I am sure I am not a danger to them, whatever their age.&#x201d;<br><br>It burned him. The newspaper was scorching through his breast pocket.<br><br>&#x201c;They were doing the right thing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They weren&#x2019;t meddling. They were the good guys.&#x201d;<br><br>The commissioner leaned back in his chair just as the quietest, meanest member of the board saw it fit to intervene. &#x201c;Still, the circum�stances are aggravating. Here you are, doing fifteen years on account of being captured by four teenagers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And a dog,&#x201d; Wickley added.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, and a dog. That must have been a blow to your ego. You had problems with other inmates because of it. Some resentment would be altogether reasonable.&#x201d;<br><br>Wickley looked down at his hands again, admired them upon find�ing them perfectly calm. Dry and undaunted, like tree trunks in the gentle breeze that carried the giggles of four teenagers. And a dog.<br><br>&#x201c;What we mean to say is that there was, so to speak, some insult added to injury in the way you were apprehended. Actually, the word in the police report is &#x2018;snared,&#x2019; &#x201d; the commissioner read. &#x201c;By means of a contraption involving . . . &#x2018;a high-speeding serving cart, two flights of stairs, and a fishing net&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>Wickley watched him frown, briefly striving to pry an image out of the type, while the giggling in his own breast pocket grew into a television laughtrack.<br><br>&#x201c;So, whatever&#x2014;what we mean to say,&#x201d; the man resumed, &#x201c;is that some extra concern about you taking revenge is not unjustified.&#x201d;<br><br>The prisoner drove his right hand to his heart. Violently. Slapping the picture silent.<br><br>&#x201c;Gentlemen. I staged a haunting in an old mansion and dressed myself as a giant salamander to scare people away. I was captured by four teenagers and a Weimaraner. And I am sixty. Do you seriously believe I pose a threat to anyone?&#x201d;<br><br>The board members chortled. The commissioner started putting away his papers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Five days and nineteen hours later, he made parole.<br><br>The riveted iron doors opened the following Monday and sun shone on Wickley&#x2019;s arid face, on the sentinel turrets, on a reservoir-sized puddle on the cobblestone road.<br><br>He put his box of belongings at his feet, took out the crumpled pack of Raleighs and lit one with the second-to-last match from his Sambo&#x2019;s giveaway matchbook. The first drag tasted rancid, and yet periorgasmically good. The legendary afterjail cigarette.<br><br>Smoke curled away in the sun like a flower out of the animated film <i>Yellow Submarine.</i><br><br>He unfolded the newspaper page he&#x2019;d transferred from his orange jumpsuit to his civilian jacket pocket, next to a movie ticket stub for <i>The Eiger Sanction. </i>The grinning children in the picture met sunlight again.<br><br>The names in the second paragraph were highlighted in faded yellow: Peter Manner, Kerri Hollis, Andrea &#x201c;Andy&#x201d; Rodriguez, Nate Rogers, Sean. Peter Manner&#x2019;s name was struck out in pen. That had been a recent addition; he&#x2019;d overheard the news in the library two years ago. &#x201c;Peter Manner, the kid in that flick with Lisa Bonet, he OD&#x2019;d,&#x201d; some convict had said, followed by the usual condescending platitudes on the rough lives of child stars and whatever. If bad fortune had struck out the other three names too, their deaths never made it to the prison grapevine. Not everyone stars in a Christmas blockbuster movie after all. The dog would most likely be a strike-out too, but lacking any official confirmation, Wickley would rather wait.<br><br>He further browsed the box for his father&#x2019;s wristwatch and strapped it on. He was due to check in with his parole officer in two hours.<br><br>He picked up his box and crossed the street to a nearby pub. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> They&#x2019;d changed the label of his favorite beer. Also that of Coca-Cola bottles, the red background now shattered in the furiously sharp-angled pattern of the new decade. Two men by the window table were talking baseball, and Wickley, sitting at the bar, didn&#x2019;t recognize a single name. He was going to light himself another cigarette when the barman approached and said, &#x201c;Sir, you can&#x2019;t smoke in here.&#x201d;<br><br> He stared at the guy&#x2019;s afterimage for a while before he tipped the cigarette back into the package and continued drinking. At least he&#x2019;d called him &#x201c;sir.&#x201d;<br><br>The <i>Pennaquick Telegraph </i>clip lay unfolded on the counter while he enjoyed his beer. The verb is not an overstatement&#x2014;he was really enjoying it. Now and then he side-glanced at the picture for no reason in particular. Perhaps because it was one of the few familiar things he could turn to: the panting dog, the smiling children. Even the dead one was smiling. Christ, even the deputy sheriff was smiling. The only one not smiling in that photo was him.<br><br>He glanced at the mirror across the counter. The old man there looked remarkably weary for someone who had spent thirteen years shelved in a cold, dry place, but not thirteen years older than the one in the newspaper. He had been blessed with one of those faces that age rapidly through the first three decades, but later remain relatively unchanged throughout adulthood. He continued not to smile now, but he somehow looked better than the detainee in the picture. Having lost the salamander costume helped.<br><br>The highlighted names stared up at the ceiling fan. He looked down at his hands and gnarled fingers slumbering on the counter, as unfazed as they were during the interview. They really didn&#x2019;t give a damn.<br><br>He stayed on his stool, drinking in little sips, listening to a new but not bad song playing on the radio. One of the men by the window loudly rejected the idea of a player Wickley had never heard of being a better pitcher than one he remembered perfectly well.<br><br>Delicately, Wickley grabbed the newspaper clip, held it up, crum�pled it into his hand, lit the last match in the book and burned it. The barman grunted at this act of arson not covered by the nonsmoking sign.<br><br>Wickley sprinkled the ashes on the floor and left for the restroom.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Life out of prison is full of easily overlooked luxuries, such as using a public urinal without having to check your back. He smiled at that adage as it shaped in his mind, and took pleasure in reading the age�less poetry scribbled on the tiles and trying to aim at the little pink spongey cube near the drain.<br><br>Thirteen goddamn years.<br><br>He was free.<br><br>Without the warning of a toilet flush, the door to the stall behind him slammed open.<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, Mr. Wickley.&#x201d;<br><br>He knew then, by the sudden suspension of all lower bodily func�tions, that his subconscious mind had recognized the voice. Even thir�teen years and a puberty later.<br><br>He spun on his feet and corrected his visual line upward and choked at the face of the bully confronting him&#x2014;the dark-browed figure fill�ing and brimming over the ghostly contour of a smiling memory.<br><br>&#x201c;Andrea &#x2018;Andy&#x2019; Rodriguez!&#x201d; he blurted out.<br><br>The woman blew a bang of black hair off her face. &#x201c;Andy.

It has also won them millions of viewers on the Food Network. Simply put, the Neelys are all about good food and good times. In this, their eagerly awaited debut cookbook, the Neelys share the delicious food they have been cooking up for years both at home and in their restaurants.</p> <p>Pat and Gina hail from families with a boundless love of cooking and bedrock traditions of sharing meals. At the Neelys&#x2019;, mealtime is family time, and that means no stinting on &#x201c;the sauce.&#x201d; Indeed, that&#x2019;s one of the Neely secrets: the liberal application of barbeque sauce to almost anything&#x2014;spaghetti, nachos, salad, you name it. Of course, there are other secrets as well, and you will find them all in the pages of <i>Down Home with the Neelys</i>, along with more than 120 mouthwatering recipes.</p> <p>Here are the tried-and-true southern recipes that have been passed down from one Neely generation to the next, including many of their signature dishes, such as Barbeque Deviled Eggs, Florida Coast Pickled Shrimp, Pat&#x2019;s Wings of Fire, Gina&#x2019;s Collard Greens, Grandma Jean&#x2019;s Potato Salad, Nana&#x2019;s Southern Gumbo, Memphis-sized Pulled Pork Sandwiches with Slaw, Get Yo&#x2019; Man Chicken, and Sock-It-to-Me Cake. Certainly, no self-respecting southerner would dream of offering a meal to a guest without a proper drink, so Pat and Gina have included some of their favorite libations here, too.</p> <p>The Neelys work, laugh, love, and play harder than any family you&#x2019;ll ever meet. Their love for good food is infectious, and in <i>Down Home with the Neelys</i>, they bring their heavenly inspired cooking down to earth for all to share.</p> <strong>From <i>Down Home with the Neelys</i>: Sweet and Spicy Slaw</strong> <br><br> <b>Pat:</b> In Memphis, if you run a barbecue joint, you better have coleslaw on your menu and it better be good (ours is some of the very best). Indeed, you could spend a day in Memphis tasting slaw from rib joints all over town. And yet there are people who visit our fair city who are hesitant to try it, especially folks from the West Coast. This is a mystery to me. Coleslaw and pulled pork go together like lettuce and tomatoes on a burger, and salted peanuts in a bottle of pop (I bet some of you haven&#x2019;t tried that, either). <br> <p>Bottom line: You come down Memphis way, you have to try our slaw. When we started Neely&#x2019;s, Tony and I recognized the importance of slaw and knew we would have to come up with a killer recipe, one that would complement our sandwiches and our sauce. It had to be sweet yet spicy, because our barbecue sauce was truly mild. We also wanted it to be coarse and fresh (with a little onion flavor, and carrots for color). A big key for us was using two types of pepper, black and cayenne, which work together as well as Tony and I do. Then came some sugar, as sweet as my Gina. All of these ingredients have given us a coleslaw we are very proud of. For years in the restaurant this was my dish&#x2014;no one made it for either location but me. I didn&#x2019;t use measuring cups; everything was done by feel. As we grew, I knew I would eventually have to develop it into a standard recipe so others could make it. Now we have customers who come in and buy slaw by the bucket to take home and have with their catfish, spaghetti, or whatever they are cooking. This recipe will convert even those West Coast hard-liners who claim they &#x201c;don&#x2019;t eat slaw.&#x201d;</p> <p><b>Gina:</b> On our show, we like to tease that Pat is the sweet and I am the spicy (only my man knows for sure!). At Neely&#x2019;s restaurants, the famous and addictive coleslaw happens to be both. We often double this recipe for parties, because leftovers are so delicious (and a food processor makes quick work of all that shredding). When making this slaw at home, it&#x2019;s a good idea to use both red and green cabbage. It&#x2019;ll give your slaw more color. Be sure to select the freshest, best-looking cabbage available for the prettiest, crispest, and crunchiest coleslaw you have ever tasted. <br> </p><p><b>Ingredients</b></p> <ul> <li>1 small head green cabbage</li> <li>1 small head red cabbage</li> <li>4 carrots</li> <li>1 medium yellow onion</li> <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li> <li>1/4 cup prepared yellow mustard</li> <li>2 teaspoons apple-cider vinegar</li> <li>1 cup sugar</li> <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black</li> <li>pepper</li> <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li> <li>Kosher salt</li> </ul> <p>(Serves 6 to 8)</p> <p><b>Directions</b></p> <p>Cut the cabbages into quarters and remove the cores. Peel the carrots and onion, and slice them into pieces that will fit through the feed tube of a food processor. Fit the food processor with the large-holed grater attachment, and push the cabbage, carrots, and onion through the feed tube to grate. In a large bowl, toss the grated cabbage, carrots, and onions to combine. </p> <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, sugar, black pepper, and cayenne (whisk until the sugar is dissolved). Toss the dressing with the coleslaw, and season with salt and additional pepper to taste. Cover the slaw with plastic wrap, and chill for at least 2 hours before serving. </p> (Neelys photo � Shelly Strazis)<b>Patrick and Gina Neely</b> are owners of Neely&#x2019;s Bar-B-Que in Memphis and Nashville and hosts of the Food Network series <i>Down Home with the Neelys</i>.

He travelled widely in Gaul and in Asia Minor; and turned in the years 373&#x2013;379 to hermetic life in Syria. Ordained presbyter at Antioch in 379 he went to Constantinople, met Gregory of Nazianzus and advanced greatly in scholarship. He was called to Rome in 382 to help Pope Damasus, at whose suggestion he began his revision of the Old Latin translation of the Bible (which came to form the core of the Vulgate version). Meanwhile he taught scripture and Hebrew and monastic living to Roman women. Wrongly suspected of luxurious habits, he left Rome (now under Pope Siricius) in 385, toured Palestine, visited Egypt, and then settled in Bethlehem, presiding over a monastery and (with help) translating the Old Testament from Hebrew. About 394 he met Augustine. He died on 30 September 420.<br>Jerome&#x2019;s letters constitute one of the most notable collections in Latin literature. They are an essential source for our knowledge of Christian life in the fourth&#x2013;fifth centuries; they also provide insight into one of the most striking and complex personalities of the time. Seven of the eighteen letters in this selection deal with a primary interest of Jerome&#x2019;s: the morals and proper role of women.

A behavior problem often becomes a &#x2018;terminal disease&#x2019;. Indeed euthanasia for behavior problems is the main cause of death in young animals, and many people regard it as a treatment. The high cost of veterinary attention also results in many animals being discarded or neglected by their owners. The consequent price of animal suffering, and cost of human regrets and need for welfare services, are incalculable.They are also avoidable. <br><br>Correcting the behavior problem often saves an animal&#x2019;s life as effectively as surgery or other medical procedures, and greatly reduces the suffering of all concerned. It does not require expensive behavior therapy or extensive behavior modification on the part of the owner. It can be brought about in many cases quite simply and inexpensively through the use of flower essences. This book offers descriptions of each of the 38 Bach Flower Remedies, and their application to the treatment of a range of domestic animals, including horses and farm, wild and zoo animals. It also describes diagnostic symptoms, animal by animal, together with appropriate treatment regimens, illustrated with case material obtained from veterinarians, animal behavior specialists and health practitioners. <br><br>Other important and helpful areas discussed are: <br>� emotions in animals and their influence on behavior <br>� the emotional bond between animals and humans <br>� the pros and cons of thinking of animals in human terms <br>� the principles of flower remedies and their suitability for usein the treatment of animals. <br><br>Helen Graham was a Lecturer at Keele University, England, and is the author of several books on psychology and complementary medicine.

The story takes us from Johnny Cash&#39;s childhood on an Arkansas cotton farm to his early years at Sun Records. We read of his life on the road and meetings with, and performances for, world leaders. There is also the darker side of his life: the years of addiction to amphetamines and pain killers, a suicide attempt and the spiritual awakening that pulled him through. He looks unsparingly at his turbulent past, but remains a man of honesty, humility and humour. His memoir reveals his friendships with Roy Orbison, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan and Billy Graham.</p><p>Johnny Cash, singer and songwriter, first sang publicly while in the US Air Force in the 1950s. His 1955 contract with Sun Records marked the beginning of his singing career. In 1996 he received a Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement Award and released his American Recordings album, Unchained. He lives in Tennessee with June Carter, his wife of 29 years.A humble, happy look back from the man in black. Johnny Cash answers to many names; he's JR to childhood friends and family, John to bandmates, and Johnny to fans. ``Cash'' is the name wife June Carter reserves for ``the star, the egomaniac.'' The star gets plenty of ink here, from the early days at Sun Records--with Elvis, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis--to his current status as a darling of the alternative rock set. But it's the private man who's most compelling and surprisingly complex. Cash writes candidly of his recurring addiction to amphetamines and his concomitant shortcomings as a father, addresses his spirituality without sounding maudlin, and displays genuine humility at his success and very little bitterness at his abandonment by the country music establishment. A more accurate subtitle might be ``The Second Autobiography,'' since this volume covers some of the same ground as Cash's previous work, The Man in Black (1986), but a life so chock full of oddments (he once started a forest fire with an automobile and on another occasion was nearly disemboweled by an ostrich) and renegade stands (he opposed Vietnam, heresy to the nation's blue- collar constituency) easily merits a second look. Organized around the domiciles where he divides his time--homes in Tennessee, Florida, and Jamaica, as well as his tour bus--the book stays grounded in the present, mixing reflections on his 40-year career with a running chronicle of an ongoing tour. This novel approach minimizes the as-told-to blahs that plague many a celebrity autobiography and highlights Cash's wry humor and introspection. With the help of Carr, editor of Country Music magazine, Cash keeps the pace lively until the end, when the roses he throws everyone from grandkids to music biz buddies bog things down. Mostly, though, a pungent, substantive autobiography from one the most iconoclastic talents on the American music scene.

She died in 1973.</p></p><h2>The Longest Cave</h2><p>In 1925 the geological connection between Flint Ridge and Mammoth Cave was proved when dye placed in a Flint Ridge spring showed up in Echo River at Mammoth Cave.<br>&nbsp;<br>That tantalizing swirl of dye confirmed specula�tions that were<i> </i>to tempt more than 650<i> </i>cavers over half a century with the thrill of being the first to make human passage of the cave connection. Roger Brucker and Richard Watson tell not only of their own twenty-year effort to complete the link but the stories of many others who worked their way through mud-choked crawlways less than a foot high only to find impenetrable blockages.<br>&nbsp;<br>Floyd Collins died a grisly death in nearby Sand Cave in<i> </i>1925, after being trapped there for 15 days. The wide press coverage of the rescue efforts stirred the imagination of the public and his body was on macabre display in a glass-topped coffin in Crystal Cave into the 1940s. Agents of a rival cave owner once even stole his corpse, which was re�covered and still is in a coffin in the cave. Modern cavers still have a word with Floyd as they start their downward treks.<br>&nbsp;<br>Brucker and Watson joined the parade of cavers who propelled themselves by wiggling kneecaps, elbows, and toes through quarter-mile long crawlways, clinging by fingertips and boot toes across mud-slick walls, over bottomless pits, into gur�gling streams beneath stone ceilings that descend to water level, down crumbling crevices and up mountainous rockfalls, into wondrous domed halls, and straight ahead into a blackness inten�sified rather than dispelled by the carbide lamps on their helmets.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over two decades they explored the passages with others who sought the final connection as vigorously as themselves. Pat Crowther, a young mother of two, joined them and because of her thinness became the member of the crew to go first into places no human had ever gone before. In that role, in July 1972, she wiggled her way through the Tight Spot and found the route that would link the Flint Ridge and Mammoth Cave systems into one cave extending 144.4 miles through the Kentucky limestone.<br>&nbsp;<br>In a new afterword to this edition the authors summarize the subsequent explorations that have more than doubled the established length of the cave system. Based upon geological evidence, the authors predict that new discoveries will add an�other 200 miles to the length of the world&#x2019; s longest cave, making it over 500 miles long.<br>&nbsp;<br></p><p>This is the gripping and suspenseful story of the magnificent achievement that has been compared to the conquest of Everest-- the final connection between the Flint Ridge and Mammoth Cave systems.<b>Roger W.

And though Abani ties his contribution up neatly at the end, he doesn&#x2019;t let the readers off easy. His story is the hardest to piece together in a chronological sense, making it the most difficult to follow narratively; he reveals much, emotionally, but very little in the way of facts or details.

You think I don&#x2019;t know you did that on purpose? Well, I&#x2019;ve got your number, shorty, so let me tell you something: Paybacks are murder.&#x201d;</p><p>Paybacks? Murder? Shorty! Hugging my purse to my chest, I gaped at the bad-tempered buffoon as he gathered his cucumbers, climbed onto his unicycle, and rode off to join his troupe. You wouldn&#x2019;t expect that kind of behavior from a clown named Snuggles.</p><p>Was it my fault he ran over my purse and fell off his tall perch? No, it was the bozo&#x2019;s behind me&#x2014;pardon the clown pun&#x2014;who was too busy stuffing his face with a bratwurst to notice the short redhead with an even shorter fuse standing in front of him. This was a small parade. He was a big guy. Did he have to be in the front row? And who eats brats at ten o&#x2019;clock in the morning?</p><p>I turned my attention back to Snuggles, who was once again juggling cukes from his seat-in-the-sky as he pedaled up the street. My policy was to stand up to bullies&#x2014;and that snarled threat was certainly bullying behavior&#x2014;but before I could give him a piece of my mind (I was thinking along the lines of recommending a place to store those cucumbers) I was yanked back onto the sidewalk by my best friend and roommate, Nikki Hiduke, an X-ray tech at the county hospital, who had shared many childhood adventures with me and lived to tell about it.</p><p>&#x201c;Abby, are you all right? You look dazed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nikki, that clown threatened me! As if I elbowed myself off the sidewalk.&#x201d; I cast a glare over my shoulder at Mr. Oblivious, who had finished his bratwurst and was slurping mustard off his fingers. I was amazed he wasn&#x2019;t also talking on a mobile phone. Oh, wait. Yes, he was. He had on an earpiece.</p><p>&#x201c;Snuggles the Clown threatened you?&#x201d; Nikki stared after the troupe&#x2014;three acrobats, two unicyclists, one stilt walker, and the last (my favorite because of the huge purple lily atop a long green stem waving from her bonnet), a baby-doll clown peddling a giant purple tricycle. &#x201c;But he looks so harmless.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let that goofy smile fool you.&#x201d; I scrubbed the black tread mark off the tan leather purse that I&#x2019;d almost gone into hock for. &#x201c;Beneath that greasepaint is a nasty temper and a voice that would make a polar bear shiver.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Abby, you have mustard on your shoulder.&#x201d;</p><p>Wonderful. I took a tissue from my tire-engraved purse and blotted the yellow stain on my white shirt. Why had I even bothered to come? It was a sunny Saturday morning, and although my flower shop, Bloomers, was open on Saturdays, this was my one weekend a month to sleep in. But no. Attending the Annual Pickle Fest Parade was a family tradition, and to break that tradition was to incur the wrath of my mom, Maureen &#x201c;Mad Mo&#x201d; Knight.</p><p>Speaking of whom, where was she? I&#x2019;d never known her to miss the start of the parade, when Peter Piper led his merry band of Pickled Peppers up Lincoln Avenue to the strains of a John Philip Sousa march.</p><p>I scanned the crowd lining both sides of the street. Today was the start of New Chapel, Indiana&#x2019;s, fall Pickle Festival&#x2014;a weeklong celebration of brine-soaked vegetables attended by thousands of people from all over the state, some from as far away as Chicago, giving the local newspaper, the <i>New Chapel News,</i> fodder for headlines such as VISITORS RELISH THE PICKLE FEST. I had a hunch it wasn&#x2019;t so much the pickled produce as it was <i>getting</i> pickled that was the actual draw.</p><p>All four streets around the courthouse square had been blocked off to accommodate the huge crowds. Restaurant owners set up tables in front of their establishments to sell beer, hot dogs, bratwurst, dills, pickled beets, pickled tomatoes, pickled watermelon, and, yes, pickled peppers to the hungry visitors. For the truly desperate, pickled herring and pickled pig&#x2019;s feet were also available. Shoe shops, gift boutiques, and clothing stores put out their wares, and even Bloomers had a display of mums, roses, asters, and greenery for sale.</p><p>Then there were the ever-popular arts and crafts booths that dotted the huge lawn around the big limestone courthouse in the middle of the square. Beneath the shady maples and elms, brightly colored canvas tents housed ceramics, watercolors, oils, clay sculpture, silver jewelry, quilts, pottery, toys, metal sculpture, and even marble birdbaths.</p><p>My mother would have her work on display somewhere in that mix. In addition to being a kindergarten teacher, Mom now fancied herself an artist, having received a pottery wheel for Christmas last year. Before she grew bored with clay, she had produced a variety of weird sculptures such as the infamous <i>Dancing Male Monkeys Table</i> and the <i>Human Footstool.</i> She had since moved on to mirrored tiles, with which she&#x2019;d covered nearly every object in her house, making a washroom visit a truly frightening experience. I didn&#x2019;t know what craft she was into this week. My father would only say, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a tickler.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you see my family?&#x201d; I asked Nikki. Being a head taller (even more if you added her spiky blonde hair), she had a sight advantage. She also had a body advantage&#x2014;slender, long legged, and small breasted, something I had aspired to from the age of thirteen. My brothers, both doctors, insisted that people stopped growing when they reached puberty, but they were only half right; I hadn&#x2019;t gone beyond my five-foot-two-inch frame since junior high, but I had gone <i>way</i> beyond my training bra.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any of them,&#x201d; Nikki said, holding up her hand to shield her eyes.</p><p>Normally, they weren&#x2019;t hard to pick out, since Jonathan and Jordan had the same flame red hair and freckled skin that my dad and I had. My mother&#x2019;s hair was a soft brown, lucky woman, and my sisters-in-law&#x2014;Portia and Kathy&#x2014;had also escaped the curse of the red.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s Marco,&#x201d; Nikki shouted in my ear as the New Chapel High School marching band passed by. She pointed between green-coated band members to the opposite side of the street, but I had already spotted him. How could anyone miss a dark-haired, virile-bodied, extremely hot hunk like Marco Salvare, a former Army Ranger and ex-cop who now owned the Down the Hatch Bar and Grill&#x2014;as well as my heart?</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that woman talking to him?&#x201d; Nikki asked.</p><p>I eyed the attractive girl beside him. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. She&#x2019;s pretty, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Pffft.</i> No way. Ew. And would you look at those split ends?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nikki, you can&#x2019;t see split ends from here, and besides, it&#x2019;s okay to agree with me. I don&#x2019;t feel threatened by the woman. I&#x2019;m not the jealous type.&#x201d;</p><p>She burst out laughing.</p><p>Ignoring her, I narrowed my eyes at the pair, watching as Marco tilted his head toward the woman to catch something she said. She couldn&#x2019;t have been a day over twenty-five, and had an oval face with delicate features framed by long, thick black hair topping off a perfectly proportioned body. She was talking animatedly and pointing to something or someone up the street. The Pickled Peppers? The clown troupe? Someone in the marching band?</p><p>&#x201c;Abigail, there you are!&#x201d; my mother called. I turned to find her parting the crowd so the humongous feathered hat on her head could fit through. Normally, she wasn&#x2019;t one to wear hats, let alone feathers, but she did have a way of surprising me. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been looking all over for you. Why aren&#x2019;t you in front of Bloomers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because we always meet here, by the Clothes Loft. Where are Dad and the gang?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By your shop, which is where I thought you&#x2019;d be.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to see the parade from Bloomers, Mom. You know it doesn&#x2019;t go down Franklin. Besides, we always meet here. If you wanted to meet elsewhere, you should have told me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would have told you if I thought there was a need to tell you. But since you&#x2019;re a shop owner now, I really didn&#x2019;t see the need.&#x201d;</p><p>I started to argue that my being a shop owner had nothing to do with it, but Nikki...</p></p><h2>The Fifth Heart: A Novel</h2><p><br>In 1893, Sherlock Holmes and Henry James come to America together to solve the mystery of the 1885 death of Clover Adams, wife of the esteemed historian Henry Adams--member of the Adams family that has given the United States two Presidents.

As an orphan, she knew tough times&#x2014;but things are changing now. Comrade Stalin has proclaimed that &#x201c;Life has become better! Life has become merrier!&#x201d; and Moscow herself is poised to join the Soviet elite. But her ambitions are thwarted when a freak accident propels her flaming from the sky. A new, stranger life begins. Moscow drifts from man to man, through dance halls, all-night diners, and laboratories in which the secret of immortality is actively being investigated, exploring the endless avenues and vacant spaces of the great city whose name she bears, looking for happiness, somewhere, still. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Unpublishable during Platonov&#x2019;s lifetime, <i>Happy Moscow</i> first appeared in Russian only in 1991. This new edition contains not only a revised translation of <i>Happy Moscow</i> but several related works: a screenplay, a prescient essay about ecological catastrophe, and two short stories in which same characters reappear and the reader sees the mind of an extraordinary writer at work.</p><p>Andrey Platonovich Platonov (1899&#x2013;1951) was the son of a railway worker. The eldest of eleven children, he began work at the age of thirteen, eventually becoming an engine driver&#x2019;s assistant. He began publishing poems and articles in 1918, while studying engineering. Throughout much of the Twenties Platonov worked as a land reclamation expert, draining swamps, digging wells, and also building three small power stations. Between 1927 and 1932 he wrote his most politically controversial works, some of them first published in the Soviet Union only in the late 1980s. Other stories were published but subjected to vicious criticism. Stalin is reputed to have written &#x201c;scum&#x201d; in the margin of the story &#x201c;For Future Use,&#x201d; and to have said to Alexander Fadeyev (later Secretary of the Writers&#x2019; Union), &#x201c;Give him a good belting&#x2014;for future use!&#x201d; During the Thirties Platonov made several public confessions of error, but went on writing stories only marginally more acceptable to the authorities. His son was sent to the Gulag in 1938, aged fifteen; he was released three years later, only to die of the tuberculosis he had contracted there. From September 1942, after being recommended to the chief editor of <i>Red Star</i> by his friend Vasily Grossman, Platonov worked as a war correspondent and managed to publish several volumes of stories; after the war, however, he was again almost unable to publish. He died in 1951, of tuberculosis caught from his son. <i>Happy Moscow</i>, one of his finest short novels, was first published in 1991; a complete text of <i>Soul</i> was first published only in 1999; letters, notebook entries, and unfinished stories continue to appear.<br><br>Robert chandler&#x2019;s translations of Sappho and Guillaume Apollinaire are published in the series &#x201c;Everyman&#x2019;s Poetry.&#x201d; His translations from Russian include Vasily Grossman&#x2019;s <i>Life and Fate</i>, Leskov&#x2019;s <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk</i> and Aleksander Pushkin&#x2019;s <i>Dubrovsky</i> and <i>The Captain&#x2019;s Daughter</i>. Together with his wife, Elizabeth, and other colleagues he has&nbsp; co-translated numerous works by Andrey Platonov. One of these, <i>Soul</i>, was chosen in 2004 as &#x201c;best translation of the year from a Slavonic language&#x201d; by the AAT SEEL (the American Association of Teachers of Slavonic and East European Languages); it was also shortlisted for the 2005 Rossica Translation Prize and the Weidenfeld European Translation Prize. Robert Chandler&#x2019;s translation of Hamid Ismailov&#x2019;s<i> The Railway</i> won the AAT SEEL prize for 2007 and received a special commendation from the judges of the 2007 Rossica Translation Prize. Robert Chandler is the editor of <i>Russian Short Stories from Pushkin to Buida</i> and <i>Russian Magic Tales from Pushkin to Platonov</i> and the author of a biography of Alexander Pushkin.<br><br>Elizabeth Chandler is a co-translator of Platonov&#x2019;s <i>Soul</i> and <i>The Foundation Pit</i>, of Grossman's <i>Everything Flows</i> and <i>The Road</i>, and of Pushkin&#x2019;s <i>The Captain&#x2019;s Daughter</i>."I squint back on our century and I see six writers I think it will be remembered for.&nbsp; They are Marcel Proust, Franz Kafka, Robert Musil, William Faulkner, Andrey Platonov and Samuel Beckett.... They are summits in the literary landscape of our century ... What's more, they don't lose an inch of their status when compared to the giants of fiction from the previous century."&#x2014;Joseph Brodsky<br><br>&#x201c;Andrey Platonov is the most exciting Russian writer to be rediscovered since the end of the Soviet Union. <i>Happy Moscow</i> shows Platonov as a master of language, weaving out of official names, political speeches, ideological exhortations and popular philosophical hopes a reality equal to the gut feel of Soviet life in the 1930s....<i>Happy Moscow</i> remains an extraordinary read, because politics doesn't get in the way. This is just what it felt like to be swept away by the Soviet ideal of a new humanity.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Independent</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;<i>Happy Moscow</i> is worth reading on countless scores. On the violence, often not physical, which a totalitarian system wreaks on the lives of those who exist within it, it is a vital counterpart to those works which deal with the more tangible horrors of the USSR, and a reminder of the unique, paradoxical power of literature to expose the mismatch between rhetoric and reality.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Spectator</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;In the Thirties Stalin proclaimed Moscow a paradise. This savage satire shows the truth through the eyes of the ebullient Moscow Chestnova. In Platonov's hands she becomes a parody of a superwoman who leaves a career in aeronautics for lovers and life. Around her is a fascinating cast of characters and, even in translation, Platonov's prose is extraordinary. This first English edition brings one of Russia's great writers to light.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Times </i>(London)<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Translated with what appears scrupulous imagination by Robert Chandler, <i>Happy Moscow</i> is stirringly readable, taking the air from totalitarian bombast and breathing new life into a neglected classic.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Observer</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;<i>Happy Moscow </i>is a full-blown masterpiece, worthy not only of consideration alongside its author&#x2019;s better-known works, but of comparison with modernist fiction&#x2019;s greatest achievements.&#x201d; &#x2014;Tony Wood, <i>New Left Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;[Joseph Brodsky] identified Platonov as the only Russian writer capable of philosophically and stylistically transcending the tragedy of the twentieth century. Chandler&#x2019;s exemplary translations are based on reliable texts, and yield the fruit of their long-standing collaboration with Russian and English speaking Platonov scholars.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></p><h2>Escape from Aleppo</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Filled with kindness and hope, but also with the harsh realities of the horrors of war, this heartbreaking </b><b>book is a necessary reminder of what many people live through every day.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</b><br> <br><b>Nadia&#x2019;s family is forced to flee their home in Aleppo, Syria, when the Arab Spring sparks a civil war in this timely coming-of-age novel from award-winning author N.H.

Because, as on most nights, Nadia was oblivious to the world, huddled beneath her bed, barricaded under a mound of blankets. Curled up beside her lay Mishmish, his purr in her ear, along with a cold, wet nose. It was her cousin Razan who finally roused her, by dragging her out from under the bed by her stockinged foot.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nadia, you oaf, wake up,&#x201d; she hissed, voice tight with fear. In her other hand, she held a sputtering candle. The warm light bobbed in the cold, dark room, illuminating Razan&#x2019;s pale, delicate features, making her appear younger than her twenty-four years.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; mumbled Nadia, gazing bleary-eyed at the window, boarded up with wooden planks. Around the edges she could see nothing but inky darkness. They were supposed to wake as the call for fajr prayers rang out in melodious Arabic, before the first light of dawn.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get your things, we have to go,&#x201d; ordered Razan, placing the candle on the desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;But we don&#x2019;t leave till the morning,&#x201d; grumbled Nadia. Then she heard it. A deep boom in the distance. She froze. That was no familiar call to prayer. &#x201c;No, no, no! Make it go away,&#x201d; she breathed, eyes squeezed shut.<br> <br>Fear curled through her belly. Her ears homed in on the echoes, imagining them as waves that rippled from a stone thrown into a pond. With lightning speed, her mind calculated the vibrations back to the point of the bomb&#x2019;s impact, a skill she&#x2019;d perfected since the war began. She imagined a narrow, thin-lipped face peering at her with a raised eyebrow. Ms. Darwish. How her algebra teacher would smirk if she found out that Nadia could now solve complex math problems in her head. Less than two years ago, her teacher had written in her report card that although Nadia was a bright student, she didn&#x2019;t apply herself.<br> <br>The report card had horrified Nadia&#x2019;s mother, who, it turned out, had been a childhood friend of Ms. Darwish&#x2019;s. They&#x2019;d attended the same school growing up, but had lost track of one another after graduation. Nadia had flippantly replied that she wasn&#x2019;t interested in algebra nor most of her other subjects&#x2014;which were boring&#x2014;except music, drama, and sometimes history: not the tedious dates, of course, but the fascinating, swashbuckling stories of kings and pirates. Her mother had ended up making an appointment with Ms. Darwish to address Nadia&#x2019;s surly attitude and lackluster performance.<br> <br>Nadia pulled the blanket over her head, wanting to burrow back in time and magically emerge at school, even if it was algebra class. Huddled in the back row with her best friends, they could joke about the rumors of how Ms. Darwish had spurned marriage in order to dedicate her life to teaching her beloved algebra. The passion for her subject, they firmly believed, extended to the man who&#x2019;d invented it, Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, whose soulful portrait hung in the classroom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t lie there, you harebrained hamster,&#x201d; Razan yelled, giving her a well-placed kick in the backside.<br> <br>Nadia grunted, the pain bringing her back to reality. The explosion was from a barmeela, a merciless barrel bomb packed with shrapnel, dumped from helicopters onto the rebel-held areas. It was a favorite of the Syrian army. This one had detonated nearly a mile away, Nadia had calculated, likely reducing its target to rubble. Her mouth ran dry as the memory of a similar bomb rose within her, the one that had left the deep scar from her knee to her hip. I can&#x2019;t go out there, she thought. She crawled back toward the security under her bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh no you don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; growled Razan, grabbing her leg. &#x201c;This is not the time for you to play ostrich.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But . . . ,&#x201d; cried Nadia, heart-racing panic building in her chest.<br> <br>Razan grabbed her face and held it close to hers. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re scared, but you have to focus,&#x201d; she said fiercely. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve practiced this and all you need to do is exit the front door. I&#x2019;ll drag you the rest of the way!&#x201d;<br> <br>Reluctantly, Nadia nodded, teeth clenched. Razan hurried toward the heavy wooden armoire. &#x201c;Get your things&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t have time to waste.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nadia crawled toward the corner of her room where she&#x2019;d put her backpack, filled days before, and double-checked to make sure her little pink case was inside. She pulled on her threadbare winter coat, running her finger across the silver pin, shaped like a fallen-over 8, fixed near the collar, then slipped on thick woolen mittens. She grabbed the special burlap case she&#x2019;d spent weeks sewing, with the help of Nana, who was always there to find a solution to her problems.<br> <br>&#x201c;Amani!&#x201d; Khala Fatima bellowed out Nadia&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s name. &#x201c;Get the kids&#x2014;we have to go!&#x201d;<br> <br>Nadia could imagine Khala Fatima standing at the front door of her apartment, down the hall from theirs, her face red with exertion, her stocky figure enveloped in a flowing gray dress. She&#x2019;d given up her favorite oranges, pinks, and yellows when snipers had taken roost atop deserted buildings, looking for targets, which more often than not ended up being defenseless women and children. Now it was best to blend in with the drab concrete wasteland that the city had become. But what her aunt said next made her blood run cold.<br> <br>&#x201c;Malik thinks the helicopters are coming this way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Malik was her cousin and Khala Fatima&#x2019;s eldest, and he and Nadia frequently butted heads, especially when he was being a bossy know-it-all. But if he&#x2019;d actually seen helicopters . . . She flew into action, despite the fear dragging down her limbs. She reached beneath the bed, pulled out Mishmish, and held the comforting mass of white-and-orange fur for a moment. Found as a newborn, the kitten had been kept alive by Razan, who&#x2019;d applied her veterinary skills. In a way, Mishmish had given life back to Razan, who&#x2019;d been lost in a well of grief after her husband was killed in a bombing at the university where they&#x2019;d both been studying. The kitten had grown fat and sleek, and to Nadia&#x2019;s consternation, because she didn&#x2019;t like animals, little kids, dirt, or disruptions, the cat decided Nadia was his. He followed her around, slept on her bed, ate off her plate when she wasn&#x2019;t looking, and brought her special treats of dead mice.<br> <br>The cat allowed himself to be secreted away inside a burlap bag and lay curled along Nadia&#x2019;s side when she slung the bag over her shoulder. She grabbed her pack and followed Razan, candle in hand, from the room. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; said her cousin.<br> <br>You can do this . . . you can do this . . . , repeated the voice inside Nadia&#x2019;s head. According to the emergency plan, her grandmother, mother, and three aunts and their children were to assemble downstairs within two minutes of an alert.<br> <br>They hurried down the dark hall of the spacious apartment that had been Nadia&#x2019;s home her entire life. It was identical to the other three apartments in the building, built by her grandparents thirty-five years ago. Each son had been given the key to his own flat, while they occupied the top floor. Mostly, they&#x2019;d all lived happily together in the rambling space as part of a large extended family. Overwhelmed by the thought that she was leaving the only home she&#x2019;d known, she tripped on her shoelaces. Instantly a sharp pain shot up her leg and she gritted her teeth. She paused to rub her leg where the pain had flared, near her knee, a few inches from where a sliver of shrapnel still lay buried.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tie your shoelaces,&#x201d; grumbled Razan, adjusting her bag.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you girls ready?&#x201d; came a breathless voice from the master bedroom. It was Nadia&#x2019;s mother.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Razan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go on downstairs,&#x201d; urged Nadia&#x2019;s mother, now in the hall. &#x201c;Razan, help Nadia,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;And, Nadia, stay with Razan and listen to what she says&#x2014;no arguments!&#x201d;<br> <br>Nadia grimaced. Razan&#x2019;s job was to make sure she didn&#x2019;t get stuck.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; said Razan, latching onto Nadia&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you coming?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just another minute,&#x201d; responded Nadia&#x2019;s mother. &#x201c;Yusuf can&#x2019;t find his shoes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nadia frowned. Her younger brother was always a pain. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll wait for you,&#x201d; she grumbled, lips twisting downward.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said her mother, eyes stern. &#x201c;You go, I&#x2019;m right behind you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Reluctantly, Nadia let her cousin propel her toward the front door.<br> <br>Her brother&#x2019;s wail echoed behind them. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want the red ones,&#x201d; he fussed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re too tight. Where are the blue ones?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t find them now,&#x201d; came her mother&#x2019;s patient voice as they exited the apartment and stepped out onto the third-floor landing.<br> <br>&#x201c;The helicopters are circling back!&#x201d; came Malik&#x2019;s bellow from above.<br> <br>Nadia imagined him somewhere on the balcony, looking out over the night sky with his binoculars. Her throat tightened at the thought of leaving. She had barely stepped outside their building in over a year . . . not since the day she&#x2019;d been hit by a barmeela. I can&#x2019;t do this, she thought. I can&#x2019;t go back out there. . . .</p><h2>Across the Plains in 1844 (Dodo Press)</h2><p>The Sager orphans (sometimes referred to as Sager children) were the children of Naomi and Henry Sager. In April 1844 Henry Sager and his family took part in the great westward migration and started their journey along the Oregon Trail. During their journey both Naomi and Henry Sager lost their lives and left their seven children orphaned. Later adopted by Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, missionaries in what is now Washington, the children were orphaned a second time, when both their new parents were killed during the Whitman massacre in November 1847. Catherine (1835-1910), the eldest of the Sager girls, married Clark Pringle, a Methodist minister and bore him 8 children. They lived in Spokane, Washington. About 1860, ten years after her arrival in Oregon, she wrote a first-hand account of their journey across the plains and their life with the Whitmans. This account today is regarded as one of the most authentic accounts of the American westward migration. She hoped to earn enough money to set up an orphanage in the memory of Narcissa Whitman. She never found a publisher. Catherine died on August 10, 1910, at the age of seventy-five.</p><p></p><h2>Holidays Around the World: Celebrate Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur: With Honey, Prayers, and the Shofar</h2><p><i>Celebrate Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur</i> examines how these Jewish High Holy Days are celebrated worldwide.

And what causes such mania to&nbsp;blossom into the lethal conviction that everything must be annihilated? There is no turning away from the imperative to study this riddle in all its mystifying complexity and its disturbing contemporary resonance&#x2015;to trace the obscure passage between a lone state of delirium and the will to world-erasure..</p><p>A fragmentary catalogue of the thousand-and-one varieties of manic disposition (augomania, dromomania, catoptromania, colossomania...),&nbsp;<i>Omnicide</i>&nbsp;enters the chaotic imaginations of the most significant poetic talents of the Middle East in order to instigate a new discourse on obsession, entrancement, excess, and delirium. Placing these voices into direct conversation, Jason Bahbak Mohaghegh excavates an elaborate network of subterranean ideas and interpretive chambers, byways, and burrows by which mania communicates with fatality. Like secret passages leading from one of the multitudinous details of a bustling Persian miniature to the blank burning immanence of the desert, each is a contorted yet effective channel connecting some attractive universe (of adoration, worship, or astonishment) to the instinct for all-engulfing oblivion (through hatred, envy, indifference, rage, or forgetting).<br>&nbsp;<br>A captivating fractal of&nbsp;conceptual prisms in half-storytelling, half-theoretical prose, a rhythmic, poetic, insidious work that commands submission, <i>Omnicide</i>&nbsp;absorbs the reader into unfamiliar and estranging landscapes whose every&nbsp;subtle euphoric&nbsp;aspect&nbsp;threatens to become an irresistible invitation to the end of all things.</p></p><p>Jason Bahbak Mohaghegh is Associate Professor of Comparative Literature at Babson College.

These and other &#x201c;poets of the lost cause&#x201d; come together in a compelling book that is a strange hybrid of Aristotle's Categories, Borges's <i>Book of Imaginary Beings</i>, and the <i>Necronomicon</i>.</p>&#x2015;<b>Eugene Thacker</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Infinite Resignation</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>In the Dust of This Planet</i></p><h2>One Small Blue Bead</h2><p><i>A band of men sat huddled in a cave<br> Where coals of fire glowed warm and red.<br> Boy lay curled on a bed of leaves<br> But he sat up when an old man said: "This thought keeps spinning in my head.<br> There must be caves just like our own<br> Somewhere<br> And other axes made of stone<br> Somewhere<br> And other men like me."</i> <br>Though only Boy shares his dream, the old man leaves the tribe to search for what the world may hold.

In Fanny&#x2019;s case these will range from contemporary fellow writers questioning ways and means in their art and all who find their enterprise of interest, to those who feel themselves confronted with deeply ingrained questions of religion, person, society, gender, politics, which almost anyone alive at this moment is trying to answer.&#x201d; (Robert Creeley)</p><h2>A Woman's View: How Hollywood Spoke to Women, 1930&#x2013;1960</h2><p>In this highly readable and entertaining book, Jeanine Basinger shows how the "woman's film" of the 30s, 40s, and 50s sent a potent mixed message to millions of female moviegoers. At the same time that such films exhorted women to stick to their "proper" realm of men, marriage, and motherhood, they portrayed &#x2015; usually with relish &#x2015; strong women playing out liberating fantasies of power, romance, sexuality, luxury, even wickedness.<br><br>Never mind that the celluloid personas of Bette Davis, Myrna Loy, Katharine Hepburn, Joan Crawford, or Rita Hayworth see their folly and return to their man or lament his loss in the last five minutes of the picture; for the first eighty-five minutes the audience watched as these characters "wore great clothes, sat on great furniture, loved bad men, had lots of sex, told the world off for restricting them, even gave their children away." <br><br>Basinger examines dozens of films &#x2015; whether melodrama, screwball comedy, musical, film noir, western, or biopic &#x2015; to make a persuasive case that the woman's film was a rich, complicated, and subversive genre that recognized and addressed, if covertly, the problems of women.</p><p>When film experts talk about the "woman's picture," a Hollywood genre that flourished in the '30s, '40s, and '50s, they often squabble over whether these films were liberating or constraining. Jeanine Basinger argues that they were both at the same time. She maintains that they freed their female protagonists to break social bonds while also punishing any women who seemed too free and feisty. This lively and exceedingly thorough book covers every major aspect of this fascinating film genre, including the roles female stars were expected to play, the fabulous clothes they wore, the social behaviors they were condemned to adopt, the ways they responded to and were treated by men, and the ideals of femininity Hollywood producers tried to impress upon their audiences. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i>6 1/8 x 9 1/4 trim. 46 illus.

Her novels set in Regency England have captivated readers around the globe, making her one of the romance world's most beloved and popular authors.</p>In this steamy Regency, the second in Laurens's new Bastion Club series (following The Lady Chosen), Lord Anthony Blake, a former spy for England, finds himself at loose ends after the fall of Napoleon. Genteel widow Alicia Carrington, who's in London to chaperone her younger sister, puts an end to Anthony's ennui when she stumbles upon a dead body at a soiree and he stumbles upon her at the same time. A mysterious villain seems determined to frame Alicia for the murder, but the real danger lies in the secret she's hiding from everyone-including Anthony, who quickly insinuates himself into her life. As in all of Laurens's romances, the love scenes are passionate, and chemistry hums between the pair. Alicia is a classic Laurens heroine: plucky and determined. Anthony is high-handed at times but not offensively so. Although the romantic tension relies heavily on a few unspoken words, it's entertaining to watch the baffled couple finally admit to their feelings. Unfortunately, the mystery subplot is less compelling, depending as it does on following a paper trail that offers up little drama. Still, Laurens's fans should be more than satisfied with this heady tale. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Genesis and the Mystery Confucius Couldn&#39;t Solve</h2><p>This book analyzes the oldest Chinese ideographs (word pictures carved in bronze and bone) to reveal that ancient Chinese history includes biblical events from creation to the flood.

After leaving her mother&#x2019;s sheltering arms, she left Florida to reside in various locales, including Washington, DC, Vermont, and southern California.

He dressed, and by the time he mentally reviewed the tasks of the day, he had convinced himself that the Borg chatter had been no more than a vestige of the dream. </p><p> The first stop was engineering. Picard entered to find the android B-4 sitting, legs sprawled with unselfconscious gracelessness, clad in the mustard jumpsuit he routinely wore. His expression bland and benign, B-4 let his ingenuous gaze wander, without curiosity, over his surroundings. Picard could not determine whether the android had actually registered the captain's entry, or the presence of Geordi La Forge or Beverly Crusher. </p><p> "Captain Jean-Luc Picard," B-4 said at last, without inflection. From experience, Picard knew this was not a greeting; B-4 was merely parroting the name of an object he recognized. But for the sake of the others, the captain took it as such. </p><p> "Good morning, B-4," he said briskly, with false cheerfulness. Silently, he nodded a greeting to La Forge and Beverly. </p><p> Geordi stood next to the android. Beverly stood across from the two of them, her arms folded, her expression carefully professional, that of chief medical officer and nothing more. Technically, since B-4 was not human, what was about to occur could not be called a medical procedure. Nonetheless, Beverly had insisted on coming. </p><p> Geordi's features were composed as well, but there was a poignant undercurrent in his prosthetic crystalline eyes. Data had been his closest friend, and spending time with B-4 -- Data's double in physical form only, certainly not in personality, intelligence, or attitude -- had only served to underscore the loss of that friend. Geordi had worked the past few months with B-4 in hopes of summoning Data's memories -- to re-create, if possible, all that Data had been. </p><p> The effort had proved cruelly futile. B-4 had regurgitated names, snippets of events from Data's past, but had never put them into context, had never shown the slightest interest in their meaning. </p><p> But as he had wandered the <i>Enterprise's</i> corridors, Geordi so often in tow, B-4 had kept Data's ghost alive for them all. Picard still struggled with a sense of guilt: in the most human and loving of gestures, Data had sacrificed himself so that his captain and crewmates might live. Even months later, Picard was visited too often by the horrible instant of materializing on the bridge, of seeing the dazzling flash of the <i>Scimitar's</i> destruction, of knowing that Data was dead, incinerated into nonexistence... </p><p> There had not even been time enough to say good-bye. He missed Deanna Troi dreadfully; she was serving with her husband Will Riker aboard the <i>Titan</i> now, and only in her absence had Picard come to realize how much he had relied on her as a counselor not only in professional matters but in personal ones as well. He was limited now to remembering what she had told him shortly before she left the <i>Enterprise</i> with Will: </p><p> <i>Data's final act was one that brought him the most happiness; it gave his entire existence the greatest meaning. Yes, he could have lived centuries longer...but what's the use of immortality if there's no meaning to it?</i> </p><p> <i>Case in point,</i> Picard thought, looking at the android in front of him. As the captain took his place beside Beverly, B-4 sat staring vacuously, oblivious to the feelings of the humans surrounding him. Data, of course, would have been keenly aware. Picard tried, and was entirely unsuccessful, to suppress a memory: Data, standing in the scalded dust of the desert world Kolarus, lifting B-4's head from the sand and holding it before his eyes in unwitting imitation of Hamlet contemplating Yorick's skull. <i>Brother,</i> Data had called him. So like Data, to have yearned for the closest of human relationships. </p><p> "B-4," Geordi said, with the same gentle tone he had used so often with his old friend, "do you realize what we're about to do?" La Forge unconsciously fingered the laser wrench in his hand. Nearby sat open storage compartments: one the size of a torso, another that of a human cranium. A third was designed to house limbs. B-4 would soon return to the state in which they had first discovered him: disassembled. </p><p> The android looked in turn at each of them: Beverly, Picard, then back at Geordi. </p><p> "You are sending me away," B-4 said. </p><p> "Yes," Geordi answered, his tone infinitely patient. "You're going to the Daystrom Institute. They're going to study you and learn about your design, how you were made." </p><p> "How I was made," B-4 echoed tonelessly. He glanced at the storage compartments, then at the deck. </p><p> "We're going to deactivate you now," Geordi persisted. "Most likely permanently. We talked about all this, remember?" </p><p> "I remember," B-4 replied, distracted by the movement of another engineer passing by en route to her station. </p><p> Apparently more for himself than the android, Geordi added, "It's a good thing you're doing, B-4. You're helping science." </p><p> After a brief silence, B-4 looked up at La Forge and asked abruptly, "What is it like to be deactivated?" </p><p> Geordi was caught off guard; Beverly stepped in. </p><p> "It's like...nothing," she said. "Like being nowhere at all. It's not uncomfortable. Humans might compare it to a dreamless sleep." </p><p> "Nothing?" B-4 tilted his head in painful imitation of Data. </p><p> Geordi recovered and nodded. "You won't see or hear anything. You'll no longer receive any input." </p><p> B-4 blinked, considering this. "That sounds very boring. I do not think I want to be deactivated now." </p><p> Geordi shot an openly helpless glance at Picard. Beside him, Beverly shifted her weight, clearly uncomfortable. </p><p> "B-4," Picard said sternly, "it's too late to change your mind. You already agreed to be deactivated. That was a good decision, one you must abide by." Now was not the time for dialogue. True, the situation might trigger memories of a lost friend, but swift action was required lest it turn maudlin. B-4 was not Data, and that was that. </p><p> There followed a slight pause. "All right," B-4 answered mildly. </p><p> Picard directed a curt nod at Geordi. "Please deactivate B-4, Mister La Forge." </p><p> Geordi hesitated no more than a heartbeat, then with his free hand, reached for a panel at the back of B-4's neck, opened it, and pressed a control. </p><p> B-4 froze: his eyes no longer blinked, his head no longer moved, his limbs no longer fidgeted in realistic representation of human motion. Even the blandly pleasant expression had resolved into one of soulless vacancy. In less than a millisecond, he was transformed from sentient being to inanimate object. </p><p> Picard had expected the moment after to be the easiest. To his surprise, it was the hardest -- for there, in front of them, sat Data, just as he had appeared all the times they had been forced to shut him down. There was no longer B-4's vacant expression and witless repetition to remind them that this was someone, something else. Picard's throat tightened; he recalled a time, many years ago, when Command had wanted to deactivate Data for study. He remembered how hard and eloquently he and Data had argued against it, and won. </p><p> Now it felt as though he had ultimately lost. </p><p> Standing beside Picard, Beverly gave a few rapid blinks, then regained her composure. Geordi, his tone soft, his words forced, said, "I'll finish up here, Captain. He'll be ready for shipment within the hour." He lifted the laser wrench in his hand and fingered a toggle. </p><p> "Very good," Picard said. He turned on his heel and tried to leave Data's memory behind, in engineering -- just as he had earlier dismissed the dream about the Borg. </p><p> It had been a strange night, followed by a strange morning; Picard could not entirely rid himself of the odd feeling the world had somehow gone awry. Nothing more than mental phantoms, he exhorted himself. Nothing real: just ghosts. Ghosts and whispers... </p><p> </p><p> As he rode the turbolift up toward the bridge, Picard's mood gradually began to lighten. His next task would be a far happier one: he had been planning an announcement with great care. The previous night, after he had received some anticipated news from Starfleet Command, he and Beverly had each enjoyed a glass of wine and laughed over his nefarious plan for delivering said news. They had planned, too, a small celebration of the senior crew after hours. </p><p> Picard was nearly smiling when the turbolift slowed and arrived at the bridge, but by the time the doors opened, he had already forced a frown in order to produce a properly grim expression. </p><p> The <i>Enterprise</i> bridge was a study in silent efficiency: a recent transfer from Security, Lieutenant Sara Nave, straw-colored hair loosely coiled at her neck, sat at the conn, studying the stars on the main viewscreen.

A fast-paced page-turner, it has everything: sex, wit, humor, and adventures. But it is an impressively researched and important story.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;David Fromkin, author of <i>Europe&#x2019;s Last Summer</i><br><i>Vienna, 1814</i> is an evocative and brilliantly researched account of the most audacious and extravagant peace conference in modern European history. With the feared Napoleon Bonaparte presumably defeated and exiled to the small island of Elba, heads of some 216 states gathered in Vienna to begin piecing together the ruins of his toppled empire. Major questions loomed: What would be done with France? How were the newly liberated territories to be divided? What type of restitution would be offered to families of the deceased? But this unprecedented gathering of kings, dignitaries, and diplomatic leaders unfurled a seemingly endless stream of personal vendettas, long-simmering feuds, and romantic entanglements that threatened to undermine the crucial work at hand, even as their hard-fought policy decisions shaped the destiny of Europe and led to the longest sustained peace the continent would ever see.<br><br>Beyond the diplomatic wrangling, however, the Congress of Vienna served as a backdrop for the most spectacular Vanity Fair of its time. Highlighted by such celebrated figures as the elegant but incredibly vain Prince Metternich of Austria, the unflappable and devious Prince Talleyrand of France, and the volatile Tsar Alexander of Russia, as well as appearances by Ludwig van Beethoven and Emilia Bigottini, the sheer star power of the Vienna congress outshone nearly everything else in the public eye.<br><br>An early incarnation of the cult of celebrity, the congress devolved into a series of debauched parties that continually delayed the progress of peace, until word arrived that Napoleon had escaped, abruptly halting the revelry and shrouding the continent in panic once again.<br><br><i>Vienna, 1814</i> beautifully illuminates the intricate social and political intrigue of this history-defining congress&#x2013;a glorified party that seemingly valued frivolity over substance but nonetheless managed to drastically reconfigure Europe&#x2019;s balance of power and usher in the modern age.</p><p>A Fulbright scholar with a master&#x2019;s degree from Cambridge University, DAVID KING is the author of the acclaimed Finding Atlantis.

Indemnity! As for me, I am a looker-on. All the indemnity I ask for is a new hat. &#x2014;Prince de Ligne<br><br>Ornate rococo carriages rumbled through a landscape scorched by twentysome years of revolution and warfare. Dangers lurked everywhere on the poor, unlit roadways. Cutthroat highwaymen preyed on isolated travelers, and inns were hardly safe havens, either, often little better than &#x201c;murderer&#x2019;s dens.&#x201d; Venturing out into the bleak postwar world was for &#x201c;the fearless, the foolish, or the suicidal.&#x201d; During the autumn of 1814, it was also for the idealistic and the idle. Hordes of pleasure-seekers would flock to Vienna for an unprecedented pageant.<br><br>The occasion was the Congress of Vienna, the long-awaited peace conference to decide the future of Europe. Kings, queens, princes, princesses, dukes, duchesses, diplomats, and about a hundred thousand other visitors would make their way to the central European city, swelling the population by as much as a third. No one, though, it must be said, really had an idea of what to expect. The invitation for the congress had been sent by way of an announcement in the newspaper.<br><br>The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars had ripped Europe apart. For the first time in history, enormous armies based on universal conscription had marched across the continent to wage a &#x201c;total war.&#x201d; France had set the standard for this comprehensive mobilization of the people with the famous decree of August 1793:<br><br>The young shall fight; married men shall forge weapons and transport supplies; the women will make tents and clothes and will serve in the hospitals; the children will make old linen into lint; the old men will have themselves carried into the public squares to rouse the courage of fighting men.<br><br>By the end of the war in the spring of 1814, the suffering had been immense&#x2014;a terrible ordeal that ruined states, wrecked economies, and ravaged families. As many as 5 million people were dead, and many more had been permanently or seriously disabled. Entire villages had been wiped off the map. Lands had been devastated, laws trammeled, and atrocities committed on a horrific scale.<br><br>The many issues arising out of this wreckage were, to be sure, tangled, thorny, and controversial. During the war, the Allied powers had understandably hoped to postpone the many difficult decisions until after victory. Now that Napoleon had been defeated, the only matter that had been officially decided was the question of France, which had been settled back in May 1814, after two months of wrangling following the capture of the capital.<br><br>According to the terms of the Treaty of Paris, France&#x2019;s frontiers were redrawn as they had been on the first of January 1792. This meant that France would have to surrender the vast majority of its conquests, but not, in fact, all of them. Any territory that France had seized by that date twenty-two years before would be retained, including communities in the northeast, Chamb�ry in Savoy, the former papal enclave of Avignon, and even some colonies in the new world. Thanks to the treaty, France would actually possess more territory and a greater population than it had under Louis XIV, Louis XV, or Louis XVI.<br><br>The Allies had hoped that such generous terms would help the new king, Louis XVIII, establish himself on the throne, and at the same time, reintegrate his country peacefully into the international community. That&#x2019;s also why the victors spared France many of the usual penalties inflicted on a defeated power. There was no indemnity to pay, no foreign occupation army to endure, and no limitation, in any way, on the size of the army. This was, in many ways, a remarkably lenient agreement.<br><br>Everything else, however, remained unresolved. The Vienna Congress would have to make some hard decisions about the former empire and its many satellite kingdoms. At stake was virtually all of western Europe, vast realms east of the Rhine, and some highly coveted islands from the Caribbean to the East Indies.<br><br>The most difficult of these questions, at least at the beginning, was the fate of Poland. Napoleon had called this country the &#x201c;key to the vault,&#x201d; and the so-called enlightened despots of the eighteenth century had tried to seize as much of its strategic territory as possible, carving it up no fewer than three times. By 1795, Poland had completely disappeared from the map, devoured, as Frederick the Great had said, &#x201c;like an artichoke, leaf by leaf.&#x201d;<br><br>Russia had ended up with the lion&#x2019;s share of Polish territory, including Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, and eastern Poland. Austria had taken the ancient capital of Krak�w, along with the rich agricultural region of eastern Galicia and the salt mines of Tarnopol. Prussia had seized Warsaw, Gd�nsk, and the strip of territory running north to the sea later known as the &#x201c;Polish Corridor.&#x201d; For many, such a cynical and ruthless display of power politics was simply indefensible.<br><br>During the war, Napoleon had played on these sentiments, blasting the Polish partitions as &#x201c;unforgivable, immoral, and impolitic.&#x201d; He promised the Poles that if they could prove to him that they were &#x201c;worthy of being a nation,&#x201d; he would restore their country. But despite the many Polish sacrifices, Napoleon never did more than create the tiny Duchy of Warsaw, and exploit it ruthlessly. The Vienna Congress seemed an excellent opportunity finally to restore Poland, though finding a solution was not going to be easy.<br><br>Napoleon, moreover, had been a fertile kingmaker, placing family and friends on thrones all over the continent, from Italy to Holland to Spain. Napoleon had also created brand-new kingdoms in Germany, such as the Kingdom of Bavaria, W�rttemberg, and Saxony. What were the victors going to do with all the newly minted monarchs desperately clutching their crowns? What, for that matter, was going to happen to the older ruling families who had been ousted in the Napoleonic whirlwind and were now lobbying for a return to their kingdoms? The Vienna Congress was gearing up for an unusual battle royal for the thrones of Europe.<br><br>In addition, there was also a controversy brewing about the works of art that had been stolen. In only a few years, Napoleon and his Grande Arm�e had earned a reputation as history&#x2019;s most audacious thieves. Countless masterpieces from Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, and Rembrandt were carted up and carried off by Napoleon&#x2019;s henchmen. The emperor&#x2019;s goal was simple: to make the city of Paris, as he put it, &#x201c;the most beautiful that could ever exist.&#x201d; The Frenchman in charge of the art confiscations, Dominique-Vivant Denon, acted with a merciless efficiency, and transformed his museum, the Louvre, into an artistic &#x201c;wonder of the world.&#x201d;<br><br>Now all these sculptures, paintings, jewels, tapestries, and other stolen treasures were once again up for grabs. The French, of course, insisted on retaining their war trophies, and the Allied powers had tentatively agreed, adding a clause to the Treaty of Paris allowing France to keep its loot. But in the autumn of 1814 there was a new call to return the art to its previous owners, and this motion was particularly popular among the heavily despoiled lands such as Italy and the Netherlands.<br><br>Indeed along with the official delegations, there were many informal and unofficial representatives, often self-appointed, that came to press their own hopes and projects. As the form of the congress had been vague, many believed that they had a right to participate in the decision making and arrived fully expecting to do so. These private delegations would be selling everything from constitutions to songs. One American entrepreneur, Dr. Justus Bollmann, arrived with a whole portfolio of projects, including a plan to create the first steamship company on the Danube.<br><br>There were delegations coming from Frankfurt, L�beck, and Prague to protect the rights of Jewish minorities, so recently granted under Napoleon and now at risk of being repealed. One group wanted the congress to launch a crusade against piracy around the world, from the corsairs infesting the Mediterranean to the buccaneers raiding the Caribbean. Representatives of publishing firms came to Vienna to address another kind of piracy, &#x201c;the gang of robbers known as literary pirates&#x201d; who unscrupulously preyed &#x201c;with impunity against authors and publishers.&#x201d; The hope was to create an international copyright to protect intellectual property.<br><br>Everyone, it seemed, had a vision of how the postwar world should best be reconstructed. The problem, however, was that the peacemakers were far more divided than it was imagined. And all the underlying differences, which had been so successfully suppressed in the life- and-death struggle against Napoleon, would now reemerge in Vienna with a vengeance.<br><br>The Habsburg capital was a good choice for the world meeting. Geographically and culturally, Vienna was the heart of Europe. Until as late as August 1806, Vienna had been the center of the Holy Roman Empire, the gigantic, ramshackle realm that had been dismantled by Napoleon. After nearly a thousand-year run, looming over central Europe at times with a menacing and other times tottering presence, the Holy Roman Empire was no more. Imperial majesty and grandeur, however, had far from faded.<br><br>&#x201c;The city proper,&#x201d; one traveler noted on entering Vienna&#x2019;s gates, &#x201c;seems like a royal palace.&#x201d; Grand baroque mansions lined the narrow, twisting lanes that snaked their way through the old medieval center. Spires, domes, towers, and neoclassical columns carved in bright white stone, each roof and facade looked more sumptuous and elaborately adorned than the next. Rows of large bay windows predominated, overlooking one of the greenest capitals in Europe, a fact that was due at least partly to the foresight of the eighteenth- century emperor Joseph II, who had decreed that a tree must be planted for every one cut down.<br><br>Vienna had indeed an aristocratic flair that many other cities like London lacked, or like Paris had lost since the revolution. Austrian, Hungarian, and Bohemian aristocrats lived there, often in mansions with their own ballrooms, riding schools, and sometimes even private opera houses. Many French �migr�s fleeing the revolution had also settled there, though most were considerably poorer now, and lived in cheaper third- and fourth-floor apartments.<br><br>The merchant class, if that term can be used about such a small group, was not that visible in Vienna, and the town&#x2019;s artisans overwhelmingly geared their production to meeting the demands of court and society, making saddles, harnesses, carriages, clocks, musical instruments, and other luxuries. The biggest source of production was still wine, which always found a ready market in a town where residents, as one historian put it, &#x201c;lunched until dinner, and then dined until supper.&#x201d;<br><br>The vast majority of the events at the peace congress would take place in the old town, still encircled by its city walls, which ran roughly along the lines of today&#x2019;s sweeping boulevard, the Ringstrasse. According to legend, the thick stone walls had been constructed using ransom money for King Richard I, &#x201c;the Lion- Hearted,&#x201d; who was captured in 1193 on his way to the Second Crusade. In reality, the walls were built and rebuilt almost incessantly over the centuries, as they withstood various sieges, including two particularly frightful ones from the Turks. After the last attack from the French in 1809, the city walls were not being reconstructed, and the remaining bastions would serve at the congress mainly as a fashionable walkway affording some excellent views of the town.<br><br>Vienna was built on a large plain where the Danube divides and can be easily forded, as the Romans who founded a camp there in the first century discovered. During the Middle Ages, the small town lay on the exposed eastern rim of Charlemagne&#x2019;s empire, a fact that survives in the German name for Austria, �sterreich. Historically, Vienna has long served as a crossroads between east and west. Crusaders, merchants, friars, and many other travelers would pass through the town, traveling east along its river&#x2014;the mighty, muddy Danube, flowing on its two-thousand-mile journey from the Black Forest to the Black Sea.<br><br>With a population reaching some quarter of a million, and ranked third in size behind London and Paris, Vienna enjoyed a reputation for being a joyous and sensuous, if also irritable and somewhat cranky, place. &#x201c;Vienna is the city of the world where the most uncommon raptures are experienced,&#x201d; as the French �migr� Baronne du Montet put it. Another admirer, the songwriter Count Auguste de La Garde-Chambonas, who had traveled extensively in his search for adventure, called Vienna enthusiastically &#x201c;the homeland of happiness.&#x201d; That autumn, the visitors to the peace conference would see exactly what he meant.<br><br>Hosting the congress officially was the emperor of Austria, Francis I, the last person ever to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Born in Florence, Italy, Francis was head of the Habsburg family, Europe&#x2019;s oldest and arguably most illustrious dynasty, occupying the throne in virtual unbroken succession since the thirteenth century. The single exception to this six-hundred-year dominance was Charles VII of the Wittelsbach family, who ruled briefly in the early 1740s, before the crown reverted to the Habsburgs (or more correctly, as they were known, from then on, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine).<br><br>Emperor Francis stood about medium height with high, sharply chiseled cheekbones, snow-white hair, and the infamous Habsburg jaw that jutted out from his bony face. He was only forty-six years old, though he looked considerably older. He had already weathered twenty- two stormy years on the throne, facing first the French Revolution and then Napoleon. Indeed, Emperor Francis looked tired and worn-out, or as one put it, &#x201c;If you blew hard, you&#x2019;d blow him to the ground.&#x201d;<br><br>As insiders knew, Francis was popular among the people and the court. He was called &#x201c;Papa Franz&#x201d; and &#x201c;the father of his country,&#x201d; and was celebrated in music, including Joseph Haydn&#x2019;s &#x201c;God Save Emperor Franz!&#x201d; (the melody still used for the German national anthem). Some family members called the white-haired emperor Venus, the goddess of love. This was admittedly something of a Habsburg eccentricity, though the emperor was a well-known lover of statues, seals, and antiquities, and he looked out with a gaze as dreamy and blank as any ancient sculpture.<br><br>When the emperor was not trying to make order out of the managed chaos of the administration, which far too often seemed to run in circles after yet another rubber stamp, Francis enjoyed the music of this great Musikstadt. The emperor played the violin in the family string quartet, sometimes accompanied by his foreign minister, Metternich, on the cello. Francis also liked to make candy, tend to his plants in the palace hothouses, and study the large collection of maps in his library. The emperor possessed a knowledge of continental geography that, among the sovereigns coming to the congress, was unmatched. His large book collection, which at his death reached forty thousand volumes, would form the core of the Austrian National Library.<br><br>The headquarters for the social maelstrom of the Vienna Congress would be Emperor Francis&#x2019;s palace, the Hofburg, or as it was known, the Burg. Originally a functional four-tower fortress built into the old city wall as part of the city&#x2019;s defenses in the late thirteenth century, the rambling palace had grown to occupy several blocks in the city center as the Habsburg rulers continually added new wings and courts.</p><h2>Treasury of Animal Illustrations: From Eighteenth-Century Sources (Dover Pictorial Archive)</h2><p><p>This magnificent sourcebook of animal illustrations, meticulously reproduced from cuts taken from rare eighteenth-century publications, features a wondrous panorama of the animal kingdom &#x2014; from long-whiskered rabbits and stately reindeer to plumed pigeons, spiny-finned fish, and magnificently patterned conchs.<br>A comprehensive volume containing more than 600 accurately detailed reproductions of copperplate engravings, this collection depicts the full spectrum of the animal world.

This volume is a must-read for readers seeking a greater understanding of race, but also for any reader who has children or parents, experienced heartbreak, or just loves the sound of finely wrought lines.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Star Tribune</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Thousand Star Hotel&nbsp;</em>skillfully weaves a range of topics&#x2014;police brutality, Asian American representation, masculinity, fatherhood, and his immigrant experience growing up in Minnesota, to name just a few.&#x201d;&nbsp;<em><strong>&#x2014;Angry Asian Man</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;While writing about his experience with racism on the streets of the Phillips neighborhood of Minneapolis, and his encounters with a cultural mainstream in which he barely sees his people represented, Phi paints a sensitive portrait of his life as both an outsider to, and a participant in, mainstream American culture.&#x201d;&nbsp;<em><strong>&#x2014;The Rumpus</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;A beautiful collection of passionate poems that explores the deep-seated trauma and discrimination in an Asian-American life.&#x201d;&nbsp;<em><strong>&#x2014;Sonder</strong></em><strong><br></strong><em><strong><br></strong></em>&#x201c;These poems are significant and weighty, but in an instant they go from somber to full of swagger, and I can&#x2019;t emphasize enough how thrilling they felt to read.&#x201d;<em>&nbsp;<strong>&#x2013;The Margins</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;[Phi] has few peers that can match him in his assessment of contemporary culture and social justice.&#x201d;&nbsp;<em><strong>&#x2014;Cultural Weekly</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;[<em>Thousand Star Hotel</em>]&nbsp;is bold in its language for experiences that oscillate between existence and erasure, and it is moving in its mission to challenge the boundaries of solidarity and to refuse neat conceptions of past, present and future.&#x201d;&nbsp;<em><strong>&#x2014;Writers&#x2019; Block Blog</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;The many fans of Bao Phi will be thrilled by this book. New readers will be seduced by his trademark blend of passion, politics, and poetry.

Yet, when Phi splits open the vulnerable and humbling moments of love, childhood, and fatherhood, he creates a body of satisfying, poignant poems that create moments of quiet introspection like diners hushed by the first bites of an anticipated meal. Bao Phi carries an honest, powerful voice, and he is not afraid to look into the boiling pots of his past or the roiling violence in America and abroad.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong>&#x2014;Tara Betts, author of&nbsp;<em>Break the Habit<br><br></em></strong>&#x201c;Bao Phi. . . cinches the balance between lively rhetoric for the stage and subtle delights on the page.&#x201d;&nbsp;<em><strong>&#x2014;The Corresponder</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;If you want a truly raw and American experience, one that just might help explain the day-to-day culmination of white supremacy, genocide, and absurd politics, then Bao Phi has a room with a tough and vital view.&#x201d;&nbsp;<em><strong>&#x2014;NewPages</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;[<em>Thousand Star Hotel</em>] is both a loving history for the poet&#x2019;s daughter and a powerful resistance to cultural erasure.&#x201d;&nbsp;<em><strong>&#x2014;Monitor St. Paul</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;Though often painful in its witness to violence, these poems offer quiet celebration of survival and resilience, often from an older adult speaker looking back at his younger self.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong>&#x2014;Brazos Bookstore</strong></p></p><h2>Harlem: The Making of a Ghetto : Negro New York, 1890-1930</h2><p>A great many books have been written about Harlem, but for social history none has surpassed Gilbert Osofsky's account of how a pleasant, pastoral upper-middle-class suburb of Manhattan turned into an appalling black slum within forty years. Mr. Osofsky sets his chronicle against the background of pre-Harlem black life in New York City and in the context of the radical changes in race relations in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He traces Harlem's change to the largest segregated neighborhood in the nation and then its fall to a slum. Throughout he neatly balances statistics and humanly revealing details. "A careful and important study.... Osofsky at once takes his place alongside James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay, and others who have looked at Harlem at close range."&#x2015;John Hope Franklin. "A pioneering scholarly achievement.... Although the subject engages his compassion, his presentation is rigorously straightforward and unsentimental and therefore all the more valuable as social analysis."&#x2015;<i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>Gilbert Osofsky taught American history at the University of Illinois at Chicago before his death in 1974. His other books include <i>Puttin' on Ole Massa</i> and <i>The Burden of Race</i>.Osofsky asks questions that really matter and writes with vigor and clarity of a man who knows precisely what he wants to say. The result is an interesting narrative combined with provocative analysis of an important subject. (Arthur Mann, University of Chicago <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>A pioneering scholarly achievement. (<i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>More than a mere picture of Harlem, colorful and exciting as it is, this is also a careful and important study of the way in which a ghetto develops.

Brady argues that ideas about nature and the environment were central to the development and success of Union military strategy.</p><p>From the start of the war, both sides had to contend with forces of nature, even as they battled one another. Northern soldiers encountered unfamiliar landscapes in the South that suggested, to them, an uncivilized society&#x2019;s failure to control nature. Under the leadership of Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan, the Union army increasingly targeted southern environments as the war dragged on. Whether digging canals, shooting livestock, or dramatically attempting to divert the Mississippi River, the Union aimed to assert mastery over nature by attacking the most potent aspect of southern identity and power&#x2015;agriculture. Brady focuses on the siege of Vicksburg, the 1864 Shenandoah Valley campaign, marches through Georgia and the Carolinas, and events along the Mississippi River to examine this strategy and its devastating physical and psychological impact.</p><p>Before the war, many Americans believed in the idea that nature must be conquered and subdued. Brady shows how this perception changed during the war, leading to a wider acceptance of wilderness. Connecting environmental trauma with the onset of American preservation, Brady pays particular attention to how these new ideas of wilderness can be seen in the creation of national battlefield memorial parks as unaltered spaces. Deftly combining environmental and military history with cultural studies, <i>War upon the Land</i> elucidates an intriguing, largely unexplored side of the nation&#x2019;s greatest conflict.</p></p><p>LISA M. BRADY is an associate professor of history at Boise State University. She is the associate editor for the journal <i>Environmental History</i>.<p>Sophisticated, nuanced, and convincing, this book makes a substantial contribution to environmental history and to our understanding of the Civil War.</p> (Mark Fiege <i>author of <i>Irrigated Eden: The Making of an Agricultural Landscape in the American West</i></i>)<br><br><p>Clearly written, fascinating in its details, and convincing in its arguments, Brady&#x2019;s book provides the first in-depth environmental analysis of Grant&#x2019;s, Sheridan&#x2019;s, and Sherman&#x2019;s campaigns in the South. The Civil War will never seem quite the same again.</p> (J. R. McNeill <i>author of <i>Mosquito Empires: Ecology and War in the Greater Caribbean, 1640&#x2013;1914</i></i>)<br><br><p>Shattered trees and ravaged fields are among the most familiar images of the Civil War, but only recently have historians begun to explore the significance of this assault&#x2015;often quite deliberate&#x2015;upon the American landscape. <i>War Upon the Land</i> is the latest and best study of this unexpected but critically important subject. Original in its approach, fascinating in its insights, thorough in its research, and marvelously written, it will be a standard work on the subject for years to come.

Most believe there's not much they can do on their own to change how much (or how little) they see. Now there is hope. In the past decade, an overwhelming number of clinical studies have shown that eating specific nutrients can help maintain vision well into old age, alleviate eye conditions, and even reverse the progress of diseases. In this book, top ophthalmologist Dr. Neal Adams uses clear, accessible language to translate research from hundreds of clinical studies in ophthalmology and nutrition to show how we can restore and maintain eyesight by changing our diet. The solution is simple: just naturally grown foods, with nutrients clinically proven to target the components of the eye affected by disease and/or age. The book explains how the eye functions and what nutrients influence these physiological processes, and includes tailored, easy-to-understand instruction on which foods and nutrients will target the reader's specific concerns.&nbsp;Particularly helpful for the 150 million Americans who visit their eye doctors annually as well as the 95 percent of Americans over 40 at risk for future vision loss.<br></p><p>Neal A.

I wasn&#x2019;t sure just how much he cared for me, even though we spent long hours and even days together, driving through the English countryside, having tea at romantic rustic inns, and staying up late to watch the stars. One afternoon while I was alone, doubts began to cross my mind. Does he really love me the way I love him? I would find out.<br> &nbsp;<br> I hiked out into the hills beyond Stratford-upon-Avon dragging my Witch&#x2019;s sword behind me. With it, I carved a circle into the earth near the ancient standing stones called &#x201c;The Roll Rite&#x201d; and lifted my voice to invoke the powers of that magical land. &#x201c;If he loves me as I love him, bring the mist of the dragon and lead him to me now!&#x201d; As I walked back a mist began to form, and when I arrived at the manor house where I was staying, my English lover was just driving in the gate. He rolled down the window of his antique car and said, &#x201c;All of a sudden I had this burning desire to see you!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Love Magic is a book of Witches&#x2019; spells and rituals to attract love and enhance relationships. You do not need to be a Witch or even be in love with a Witch to use this book. In fact, Love Magic is written both as a sensible guide for readers who already practice magic and as an introduction for people who know nothing about it. I hope that adepts of the magical arts as well as novices will find the book useful, entertaining, and enlightening.<br> &nbsp;<br> From our own separate backgrounds Tom and I weave together several rich traditions and many years of experience.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am an ordained High Priestess of Witchcraft, descended from Celtic ancestry with Faerie blood coursing through my veins. Love magic has always been a vital ingredient in my life as it is in any Witch&#x2019;s daily practices because there is little that is more important than warmth, caring, affection, and pleasure. I first began my study and practice of Witchcraft forty-two years ago, when practitioners were virtually nonexistent. Knowledge of the Craft was closely guarded and, because of the fear of persecution, confined to family traditions. The lack of information about real magic created within me a passionate determination to uncover the reality of Witchcraft and master the Art.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since that time, I have founded the Cabot Tradition of the Science of Witchcraft, which blends scientific and natural law with psychic abilities and Witchcraft practices. I have shared my knowledge of ancient and modern Celtic Witchcraft, the Egyptian Mysteries, Hermetics, Spellcraft, Herbcraft, psychic healing, ritual magic, and mental alchemy with thousands of people who have attended my classes and seminars over the past thirty-three years. I have also organized and led public rituals as well officiated at sacred functions in Salem. It has been a joy and confirmation of my efforts to see the explosive growth of the modern Craft. Indeed, Witches are now once again members of an international and ageless community that preserves ancient wisdom and worships the Great Mother, She who was old when the world was young.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tom has been a student and teacher of shamanic practices and other visionary work for twenty years. His work has roots in &#x201c;core shamanism&#x201d; as well as in specific strains of Native American spirituality and the Celtic origins of modern Witchcraft. As a North American and the son of families going back to Celtic and Germanic ancestors, he unites the Old Ways of both places in his personal spiritual life. Tom has helped organize public rituals in New York City to celebrate pagan earth holidays. He is active in the grass-roots dreamwork movement and the neo-pagan revival to reintroduce the ancient folk customs to modern Americans. He lectures extensively on dreams, shamanism, and mysticism.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our understanding of magic webs backward into the very distant past and forward into what we hope to create for the twenty-first century, while our understanding of love and human relationships derives from the people we have loved in our own lives and from the joys, hopes, and sorrows brought to us by the people we advise as spiritual counselors.<br> &nbsp;<br> No one has all the answers or insights, or even knows all the questions, about a subject as profound and mysterious as the human heart. It is therefore with utmost respect for my readers, who may see more keenly into the mysteries of love than I do, that I offer whatever knowledge and experience the Goddess and God have given to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I encourage those of you already experienced with magic to use the spells and rituals as springboards for creating your own work. The most powerful spells always come from the heart and mind of the magic-worker, not from the pages of a book. For readers new to magic, I suggest you peruse the entire book before attempting any spells and rituals, then begin with the ones that seem most appropriate for your own needs and your own level of spiritual practice.<br> &nbsp;<br> The book is divided into three parts. The first (Chapters 1 to 3) presents an overview of magic and love. The second part (Chapters 4 to 6) contains rituals and meditations for self-discovery and self-esteem, both necessary for magic and love. The last section contains three chapters of specific spells and rituals for attracting a lover, for enhancing a relationship, and for ending a relationship. The final chapter shows how to find the ingredients for love magic in the natural environment.<br> &nbsp;<br> To use this book, you don&#x2019;t have to change your religious or metaphysical beliefs to work spells and rituals. In some cases, you may have to &#x201c;suspend disbelief&#x201d; about magic, much like you suspend your knowledge at the theater that the action of the play is only &#x201c;acting.&#x201d; In most cases, you don&#x2019;t have to believe anything specific. But, as in all areas of life, it is necessary to have a strong and abiding belief in yourself and the greater Power that creates and fills the cosmos.<br> &nbsp;<br> Magic is a craft, a set of practices, a way of focusing your will and intention. It is something you do, not something you believe and it works remarkably well for people of widely varying belief systems.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some readers may ask: What is a Witch? How does a person become one? I refer you to our first book Power of the Witch, where I deal with these questions more thoroughly. But to satisfy your curiosity, I can say briefly: Witchcraft is rooted in the pre-Christian spiritual and healing practices of the early European cultures. Like ancient people everywhere, the first Witches were earth-oriented people, in love with the changing Wheel of Life manifested in the seasons of the year, the animal and plant life with which they shared the planet, and the powers of the mind and heart. They found the earth to be wondrously alive with spirits and deities, with elemental powers charged with divine energy, and with marvelous opportunities to dream and wonder about human life: its origins, its purpose, its destiny. They found answers and intimations of answers to their dreams and questions in the natural world around them and in their relationships with each other. Witches are people who strive to keep alive these ancient visions of the natural harmony and balance of nature and to participate in the Wheel of Life.<br> &nbsp;<br> And how does a person become a Witch? How do you know you are not a Witch already?<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Beate Not the Poore Desk: A Writer to Young Writers</h2><p>For the first time National Book Award winner Walter Wangerin Jr turns his keen eye upon the craft of writing By adding a lifetime of experience to the wisdom and examples of other writers Shakespeare Goethe Berry Chaucer and many more he builds for us an intricate picture of the craft and its subtlties But in revealing his personal missteps his own processes and his own story Wangerin provides lampposts for young writers as they embark on the long road toward mastery Through practical advice ethical considerations and a master s definition of art itself Wangerin draws us all closer to what it means to write and to write well</p><p></p><h2>Common Laboratory Tests Used by TCM Practitioners</h2><p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners need to have an understanding of Western medical testing to recognize when laboratory tests are required and to interpret test results that are brought to them by patients.

There are times when the human race falls so deeply into despair that it seems only a visit from God can bring it back from the brink of utter devastation. Many people, when they look at the dangerous problems in today&#39;s society, can see that we live in just such a time. With his characteristic warmth and sincerity, Joshua makes his eagerly awaited return to answer this fear as he confronts the needs and injustices that face the residents of a nameless city. But this is a Joshua you&#39;ve never seen before, one who overcomes such endemic urban problems as poverty, racism, and AIDS -- one who even confronts the terrifying realities of mental illness and satanism. In a community where these seem like insurmountable problems, Joshua sows the seeds of renewal with his words of love. He reaches out to every person with transforming openness and shows the possibilities for bringing about the regeneration of the city, even bringing about undreamed-of economic revitalization. But other problems remain for the inhabitants of this world of despair, which money cannot help. It is, most importantly, to these residents that Joshua addresses his message of acceptance. This inspirational series of novels about the return of Jesus in the present day now reaches important conclusions with its fourth installment. The message of Joshua has never so closely addressed such urgent matters, and, in the end, the reader is given hopeful answers that lead in the direction of peace and understanding.Father Joseph Girzone retired from the active priesthood in 1983 for health reasons.

This is the first comprehensive guide to giant trevally fishing on the fly.<br>The giant trevally is an apex predator, and the way it operates is nothing less than brutal. These �&#x20ac;&#x2dc;gangsters of the flats�&#x20ac;&#x2122; are like packs of hoodlums marauding across the atolls and shallow estuaries. Hunting for trevally in the harsh environment they inhabit needs a certain resolve. The flyfisher�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s first encounter with a giant trevally will be an electrifying experience. A GT can destroy tackle and ego, leaving all in its wake.<br><br>But once you�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve caught one, GT flyfishing is an experience that any angler will want to repeat.</p><p>Peter McLeod has worked in flyfishing travel for over 20 years and founded flyfishing specialists Aardvark McLeod International, in 2005. He has visited over 60 fishing locations in 20 different countries, some of them as many as nine times. He has travelled widely in his quest to find the finest flyfishing experiences in the world. His fascination with the trevally species is bordering on the obsessive and he is constantly scouring the globe for that next mind-blowing hotspot to target these bulldogs of the flats.So where do we find GTs? These predators are one of the most opportunistic feeders swimming in the ocean. To catch a GT on a fly you are first going to have to enter their environment and then hunt them in it. There is nothing random about how GTs move. Their movements are dictated by their unique understanding of their environment and the availability of food. And, in a similar way to humans, individual fish have their own characteristics and preferences. <br><br>Although their overriding motivation for being in a particular locale is dictated by water temperature, tide levels, available food sources and seasons, an understanding of the areas they frequent is vital. There is no quick and easy fix; it is just a question of understanding what motivates them, covering the ground and putting in the hours on the flats and the other areas they hang out. The more ground you cover and the more of their environment you can visit, the more chance you have of getting a shot. When that shot comes, you need to be ready as the opportunity comes and goes like a match lit in a wind. It can be not only physically but also mentally challenging to maintain that level of concentration for an extended period of time, often while just trying to stay upright on coral or surf.<br><br>As these bruisers are so adaptable, their hunting grounds range from offshore rock pinnacles to coral reef edges, channels, flats and estuarine systems. Juveniles tend to be more prevalent in estuaries and river systems where, like baby tarpon, they feel safe from larger predators and in turn can hunt other bait living there for the same reasons. Once they attain a certain size, perhaps 20-40cm, they will begin to group together and move out to deeper water to find structure such as a coral reef, bombies, drop-offs or channels. These locales contain strong currents where schools of bait are buffeted, making them easy targets for the fast and powerful trevally. As a rule of thumb when on the flats, the larger the group of GTs, the smaller the fish are</p><h2>Collected Poems | Louis MacNeice</h2><p>It is no longer necessary&#x2014;and not before time&#x2014;to &#x201c;make a case&#x201d; for MacNeice as a poet. He had a couple of decades of fame, and more of comparative neglect, but his contemporaries read him poorly on the whole, even when they were most appreciative: as a &#x201c;30s poet&#x201d; or &#x201c;journalist,&#x201d; as the author of a few near-perfect lyrics, and even as a &#x201c;professional lachrymose Irishman.&#x201d; Fortunately, errors of this order no longer need detailed correction. More to the point, it is the generations of poets, in Ireland as well as Britain, who have learned so much from MacNeice&#x2014;formally, as well as in other ways&#x2014;who provide the most potent argument for his poetry&#x2019;s continuing life. Two Irish poets in particular&#x2014;Derek Mahon and Paul Muldoon&#x2014;would be unrecognisable without MacNeice&#x2019;s example and influence; and others, from later Irish generations still, are continuing to discover and make creative use of resources in the poems of this writer who died before they were born.</p><p>Frederick Louis MacNeice was born in Belfast in 1907. He attended Oxford, where he majored in classics and philosophy, and was part of the generation of poets that included W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender and C. Day Lewis. He taught at the University of Birmingham and at Bedford College for Women, until he joined the BBC in 1941 as a staff writer and producer. Some of his best-known plays, including Christopher Columbus (1944) and The Dark Tower (1946), were originally written for radio and later published. Although he chose to live the majority of his adult life in London, MacNeice frequently returned to the landscapes of his childhood, and he took pride in his Irish heritage. In August of 1963, MacNeice, on location with a BBC team, insisted on going down into a mineshaft to check on sound effects. He caught a chill that was not diagnosed as pneumonia until he was fatally ill. He died on September 3, 1963, at age 55, just before the publication of his last book of poems, The Burning Perch.Major poets, like trick-or-treaters, tend to arrive in pairs or small groups (whether this is a matter of fate or academic convenience may be debated). And yet from roughly 1930 to 1950, British and Irish poetry seemed to fall under the sway of a single writer: W. H. Auden. Auden was hardly a solitary figure, of course his compatriots included Louis MacNeice, Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis (father of Daniel), and the four writers were once thought to be so intimately related that the poet Roy Campbell referred to them as MacSpaunday. But it wasn t a relationship of equals: the MacSpaunday poets were usually considered notable not because of how closely they resembled one another, but because of how much the other three looked like Auden.<br><br>That has begun to change for Louis MacNeice, whose reputation has been steadily rising for 20 years in Britain and Ireland, in part because of vigorous support from Irish writers like Edna Longley, Paul Muldoon and Derek Mahon. MacNeice s Collected Poems has finally been published in the United States, where readers will now have a chance to approach this under�estimated writer on his own terms....<br><br>He is one of the 20th century s great poets of loneliness. And yet this aspect of MacNeice can be easy to overlook, in part because he seems (as is frequently said of Auden) entirely comfortable with the rhythms and clutter of the modern world: Cubical scent-bottles artificial legs arctic foxes and electric mops. We think of solitary poets as writing about ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas; we don t usually think of them as being interested in electric mops. <br><br>Nor do we think of them as being fluent. Yet MacNeice is effortlessly, almost ridiculously articulate he seems capable (again like Auden) of writing about nearly anything, and in nearly any form. The 800 or so pages here include tiny poems (the nine-line Upon This Beach ); book-length poems ( Autumn Journal, which helped make his reputation); book-length poems in terza rima ( Autumn Sequel, which nearly undid it); virtuoso deployment of nearly all forms of rhyme ( London Rain rhymes a word with itself in every stanza); and a vocabulary that suavely extends from Tom or Dick or Harry and trams to ochred and � archaize. Surely a poet of loneliness should do a little more stammering.<br><br>Or should he? The difference between loneliness and mere solitariness, after all, is that the lonely sensibility wants to be otherwise. There is a reaching out that never quite touches. In MacNeice s best work, the ingeniousness and inevitable failure of that reaching indicates the depth of the longing. He is a superb love poet, for instance, yet his love poems often foreground their own ephemerality, like ice sculptures in the summertime. Consider Meeting Point, which is about the fiction writer Eleanor Clark, one of MacNeice s many, many paramours. ...<br><br>What we most want, MacNeice suggests, is simply to know each other better, but that possibility depends on laboring blindly through darkness. With the publication of Collected Poems, MacNeice s own excavation is now complete; readers who meet him halfway will find a passage that opens and opens and opens. --New York Times Book Review</p><h2>The Shaman&#39;s Toolkit: Ancient Tools for Shaping the Life and World You Want to Live In</h2><p>According to Sandra Ingerman and thousands of years of shamans before her, it is not what we do but who we are and what we are willing to become that affects our happiness, the health of our communities, and ultimately the planet itself. The Shaman&#39;s Toolkit teaches us how to root out the beliefs that are limiting us, how to heal our inner lives and become the people we most want to be, and how to utilize ancient shamanic principles of manifestation to help shape the world we want to live in. This is shamanism with a kind of social change agenda. It&#39;s about having the happiest and most fulfilling life possible and becoming a truly effective world citizen and change maker. (This book was originally published in 2010 as How to Thrive in Changing Times.)</p><p>In a time when people feel overwhelmed by global problems Sandra Ingerman shares with us spiritual practices we can all engage in that have the power to create positive change. Readers will be guided toward living a conscious life; they will learn how their thoughts and words impact the world they live in and how their core beliefs influence what they believe is possible. They will learn different ways to release and dissolve limiting beliefs and to utilize ancient principles of creation and manifestation to usher in healing the planet. Readers will be encouraged throughout to perceive themselves as members of a growing global community of conscious change agents, because that, Ingerman believes, is how we will survive changing times and how the earth will be healed.Sandra Ingerman, MA, is the author of several books including <i>Soul Retrieval, Shamanic Journeying</i>, and <i>Awakening to the Spirit World</i>.

He used Greek myth to explore the disturbing moral dilemmas of our times. <i>Antigone</i>, his best-known play, was performed in 1944 in Nazi-controlled Paris.</p>&#x201c;In Jean Anouilh there is a constant alternation between moods of brave affirmation and bitter protest; affirmation of life's primal glory, protest at what modern urban<b>--</b>particularly French<b>--</b>man has made of it . . .

In public talks worldwide, he strove to free listeners from conventional beliefs and psychological mind-sets in order to understand what is. The essential message of J.

In talks and teachings to audiences worldwide, he extricated his listeners from the tangled net of ideas, organizational beliefs and psychological mind-sets and pointed them to the bliss of truth.

He was first discovered by the Theosophists on a beach in South India in 1910 at the age of 13 and was educated to be the new World Teacher for the ages. Then he took an extraordinary turn. In 1929, at one of the enormous annual European gatherings of the Theosophists in Holland, he announced his decision to step down from any formal role to promote him as a World Teacher, resigned as figure head of the Theosophists, and cut all ties to any notion of a religious or spiritual organization.Krishnamurti claimed no allegiance to any caste, nationality or religion and was bound by no tradition. His purpose was to set humankind unconditionally free from the destructive limitations of a conditioned mind. For nearly sixty years, he traveled the world and spoke spontaneously to large audiences until the end of his life in 1986 at the age of 90. He had no permanent home, but when not traveling, he often stayed in Ojai, California, Brockwood Park, England, and in Chennai, India. In his talks, he pointed out to people the need to transform themselves through self knowledge, by being aware of the subtleties of their thoughts and feelings in daily life, and how this movement can be observed through the mirror of relationship.</p><h2>Style: The art of writing well (Harriman Modern Classics)</h2><p>"The best book on the art of writing that I know is F.

L. Lucas takes us through his ten points of effective prose style and provides a tour of some of the best (and worst) that has been written in a number of languages and literatures.

She was courageous. No one gave her orders. Once she even went to war against the emperor of Rome. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When things feel overwhelming for Amina, her mother reminds her to think of Zenobia and be strong. Amina is a Syrian girl caught up in a war that reaches her village. To escape the war she boards a small boat crammed with other refugees. The boat is rickety and the turbulent seas send Amina overboard. In the dark water Amina remembers playing hide and seek with her mother and making dolmas (stuffed grape leaves) and the journey she had to undertake with her uncle to escape. And she thinks of the brave warrior Zenobia.<br><i> Zenobia</i> is a heartbreaking and all-too-real story of one child's experience of war.

Unique during World War II, the First Special Service Force evolved as the amalgam of two Armies, Canadian and American, and the men who filled its ranks were among the hand-picked best from throughout North America. Their diverse and intensive training took them from the dust-covered prairies of Montana, to the bitterly-cold peaks of the Great Divide, to the waters of Chesapeake Bay. Their skillfulness, their remarkable esprit de corps, and their legendary endurance saw them through tough combat missions in both the Asiatic-Pacific and the European Theaters of operation. The Supercommandos chronicles the organization, training, and combat operations of the First Special Service Force during its brief but exhilarating history. Accompanying the broad text are nearly 400 black and white images, most unpublished, including a photo-essay by renowned combat photographer, Robert Capa. As well, there are more than forty extraordinary full-color wartime images of the Force both in training and in the combat zone. Beautifully rendered full-color maps, highly detailed Order of Battle graphics, charts, and numerous facsimiles of noteworthy original Force documents are also included. Completing this volume are over eighty full-color images of exceptionally rare, authentic First Special Service Force uniforms, insignia, weapons and equipment. The Supercommandos offers an unparalleled view of one of the world&#x2019;s all-time military elites, and will prove to be an invaluable resource for any collector, reenactor, veteran, or historian.</p><p></p><h2>Best American Poetry 2017 (The Best American Poetry series)</h2><p>Edited by Pulitzer Prize-winner and nineteenth US Poet Laureate Natasha Trethewey, <i>The Best American Poetry 2017</i> brings together the most notable poems of the year in the series that offers &#x201c;a vivid snapshot of what a distinguished poet finds exciting, fresh, and memorable&#x201d; (Robert Pinsky).<br><br>Librarian of Congress James Billington says Natasha Trethewey &#x201c;consistently and dramatically expanded the power&#x201d; of the role of US Poet Laureate, holding office hours with the public, traveling the country, and reaching millions through her innovative PBS NewsHour segment &#x201c;Where Poetry Lives.&#x201d; Marilyn Nelson says &#x201c;the wide scope of Trethewey&#x2019;s interests and her adept handling of form have created an opus of classics both elegant and necessary.&#x201d; With her selections and introductory essay for <i>The Best American Poetry 2017</i>, Trethewey will be highlighting even more &#x201c;elegant and necessary&#x201d; poems and poets, adding to the national conversation of verse and its role in our culture.<br> <br>The Best American Poetry is not just another anthology; it serves as a guide to who&#x2019;s who and what&#x2019;s happening in American poetry and is an eagerly awaited publishing event each year.

The American black church, according to Fauset and other contemporary researchers, provided the one place where blacks could experiment without hindrance in activities such as business, politics, social reform, and social expression. With detailed primary accounts of these early spiritual movements and their beliefs and practices, <i>Black Gods of the Metropolis</i> reveals the fascinating origins of such significant modern African American religious groups as the Nation of Islam as well as the role of lesser known and even forgotten churches in the history of the black community.</p><p>In her new foreword, historian Barbara Dianne Savage discusses the relationship between black intellectuals and black religion, in particular the relationship between black social scientists and black religious practices during Fauset's time.

When Japanese and Russian expansionist interests collided over Manchuria and Korea, the Tsar assumed Japan would never dare to fight. However, after years of planning, Japan launched a surprise attack on the Russian Port Arthur, on the Liaoyang Peninsula in 1904 and the war that followed saw Japan win major battles against Russia. This book explains the background and outbreak of the war, then follows the course of the fighting at Yalu River, Sha-ho, and finally Mukden, the largest battle anywhere in the world before the First World War.</p><p>This unique series studies every major war in history looking at all the aspects of war, from how it felt to be a soldier to the lasting impact of the conflict on the world around it.After leaving Oxford in 1953 Geoffrey Jukes spent 14 years in the UK Ministry of Defence and Foreign and Colonial Office, specialising in Russian/Soviet military history, strategy and arms control. From 1967 to 1993 he was also on the staff of the Australian National University.

The gods he worshiped took the form of other beasts or were the patterns of the stars he saw above him each night in the sky, which he transformed into figures and around which he created stories. Soon, however, man learned to imitate the animals that attacked him and he became a hunter. This transformation, Calasso posits, from defenseless victim to hunter was a key moment, the first step on man&#x2019;s ascendance to power. Suddenly the notion of the hunter became fundamental. It would be developed over thousands of years through the figures that became central to Greek mythology, including the constellations. Among them was Orion, the celestial hunter, and his dog, Sirius.</p><p>Vivid and strikingly original, and expertly translated from the Italian by Richard Dixon, <i>The Celestial Hunter </i>traces how man created the divine myths that would become the cornerstones of Western civilization. As Calasso demonstrates, the repercussions of these ideas would echo through history, from Paleolithic to modern times. And they would be the product of one thing: the human mind.</p></p><p><b>Roberto Calasso</b> is the publisher of Adelphi Edizioni in Milan and the author of many books. <i>The Celestial Hunter</i>is part of his work in progress that includes <i>The Ruin of Kasch</i>,<i> The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony</i>,<i> Ka</i>,<i> K.</i>,<i>Tiepolo Pink</i>,<i> La Folie Baudelaire</i>, <i>Ardor, </i>and <i>The Unnamable Present</i>.

She is also a professional lyricist and a licensed wild bird rehabilitator. She lives in Oklahoma with her husband, artist Larry Dixon, and their flock of parrots. She can be found at mercedeslackey.com.The Heralds came through the village of Riverend in the spring, when the snows had receded and the passes, in the steep roads and treacherous flats of the mountains, were opened. Heralds seldom stopped in the village, although they rode through it from time to time.<p>When they did, Kayla took the little ones from the hold and made her way down to the village center to watch them ride through. She would bundle them one at a time in the sweaters and shawls that kept the bite of spring air at bay, and gently remind them of foreign things--manners, behavior, the language children should use in the presence of their elders.</p><p>She would remind them of the purpose of Heralds, and promise them a story or two if they behaved themselves, and then she would pick up the children whose toddling led them to cracks in the dirt, sprigs of new green, sodden puddles--in fact, anything that caught their eye from the moment the hold's great doors were opened--and hurry them along; in that way, she managed to keep them from missing the Heralds altogether.</p><p>This spring was the same, but it was also different; every gesture was muted, and if she smiled at all, it was so slight an expression that the children could be forgiven for missing it. It had been a harsh winter.</p><p>A terrible winter.</p><p>And the winter had taken the joy out of Kayla so completely the villagers mourned its passing and wondered if it was buried with those who had passed away in the cold.</p><p>On this spring day, the Heralds stopped as the children gathered in as orderly a group as children could who had been cooped up all winter.</p><p>There were two, a man and the woman who rode astride the Companions that set them apart from any other riders in the kingdom of Valdemar.</p><p>``Well met,'' the woman said, nudging her Companion forward at a slow walk. Kayla heard the whisper that started at one end of the small group and traveled to the other. She almost smiled.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Mitchell and Evan began to shove each other out of the way in an attempt to be at the front of the group. Kayla set Tess down and separated them, grabbing an elbow in either hand. She didn't need to speak; her expression said everything.</p><p>Bells caught light and made of sound a musical cacophony, which was not in fact dissimilar to the sound it evoked from the children, whose quarrels fell away in the wake of shared wonder.</p><p>Well, almost all of the quarrels at any rate; there was still some scuffling for position, with its attendant shoving and hissed accusation. Given everything, this was almost angelic behavior; it wouldn't be good enough for the old aunts, but it was good enough for Kayla. Two years ago, she would have asked for more--and gotten it, too--but two years ago, behavior had seemed so much more important than it was now.</p><p>These children were the children of winter, and the winter was harsh; she knew that if half of them lived to be eight, the village would count itself lucky; if half of those lived to be fifteen, it would count itself more than that.</p><p>The Herald, an older woman with broad hips and an easy smile, watched the children from the safe distance of her Companion's back; her Companion, on the other hand, had no difficulty wandering among the many outstretched--and upstretched--hands. The second Companion seemed to have a more obvious sense of personal dignity--or at least a healthy caution when it came to children; it was hard to say which. Her rider was a handful of years older than Kayla, if at all, but his face was smooth and unblemished by either time or war, and he seemed both grave and dignified in a way that reminded her of her dead. Riverend was a harsh, Northern town; the dead were many.</p><p>``Youngling,'' the older Herald barked, her voice loud but not unfriendly.</p><p>Mitchell leaped up about six feet, straining to look much older than his handful of years. ``Yes, ma'am!''</p><p>The young man who rode at her side laughed. ``Ma'am, is it?'' His glance belied the gravity of his expression; Kayla liked the sound of his voice.</p><p>``Obviously I don't look as young as I'd like to think I do. Ah well, time is cruel.'' Her smile showed no disappointment at that cruelty as she looked down at Mitchell. ``You know the people of the village by name?''</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>``Good. I'm wondering where Kayla Grayson lives.''</p><p>Mitchell lifted a hand and pointed toward the large hold.</p><p>``Will she be down at the mines, or up at the hold?''</p><p>He frowned. ``Neither.''</p><p>Kayla said nothing.</p><p>But she felt it: a change in the older woman's mood and intent; there were currents in it now that were deeper than they should have been. She snuck a glance at the man, and listened carefully. There, too, she felt a determination that was out of place. It put her on her guard.</p><p>``Why are you looking for Kayla?'' she asked.</p><p>``We've heard a bit about her, and we--well, I at least--thought it would be nice to meet her on our way through Riverend. We don't often get much call to travel this way.''</p><p>``What have you heard?''</p><p>``Well, for one, that she's Magda Merton's daughter, the last of four, and the one most like her mother.''</p><p>Kayla hesitated a moment, and hid that hesitation in the action of lifting a child to the wide, wide nostrils of a very patient Companion. She had the grace to wince and pull back when the child's first act was to attempt to shove his whole hand up the left one.</p><p>``That's true,'' she said at last. ``At least, that she's the last of her daughters. You'll have to judge for yourself how much alike they actually are.'' She straightened her shoulders, shifting her burden again with an ease that spoke of practice. ``Because I'm guessing you knew my mother.''</p><p>The Herald's expression shifted; it didn't matter. Kayla already knew what the woman was feeling. Surprise. Concern. Hope. ``So you're Kayla.''</p><p>``And you?''</p><p>``Anne,'' the woman replied. She reached out with a hand, and after only a slight hesitation, Kayla shifted the boy to one hip, freeing one of hers. She shook the Herald's hand and then turned to face the quieter young man. ``If you want to join us, there's food, but I'll warn you, it's spare; we can offer you news, or trade, or water--but we barter for most of our food, and only Widow Davis has stores enough to entertain important guests.''</p><p>The Heralds exchanged a look, and then the young man smiled. ``We're well provisioned. We'd be happy to offer food for our discussion or news.''</p><p>``He means--and is too polite to say it--gossip.''</p><p>But Kayla felt the twinge of guilt that hid beneath the surface of those cheerful words, and her eyes fell to the saddlebags that his Companion bore without complaint. It occurred to her that the Companions and their Heralds seldom carried much food with them, for the villages who fed and housed them were reimbursed for their troubles, and at a rate that made it especially appealing for the poorer towns.</p><p>But when the man dismounted and unstrapped the bags from the side of his Companion, she knew, she just knew that they had been brought solely to be offered to Riverend. And she didn't like it, although she couldn't say why.</p><p>``Your pardon,'' he said, dipping his head slightly, ``for my manners. My name is Carris.''</p><p>``And her name?'' She asked, staring at his Companion.</p><p>The Herald smiled. ``Her name is Arana. She is a queen among Companions. And knows it,'' he added ruefully.</p><p>Kayla nodded quietly and turned away. ``The hold is dark, even at this time of day; there is only one room with good windows. Shall I send for the mayor?''</p><p>``No. No, that isn't necessary. It's really an informal visit.'' Anne frowned. ``And yes, I did know your mother. She was a very, very stubborn woman.''</p><p>``You know that she died.''</p><p>Anne nodded, and there was a very real weariness in the movement. ``Aye, I know it.'' But she added no more. Instead, she turned to her Companion and began to unstrap her saddlebags as well. They were equally heavy.</p><p></p><p>``I won't lie to you, Kayla,'' Anne said, as she took a seat while Kayla set to boiling water for the tea and herbal infusions that the Southerners often found too thin or too bitter. ``I did not know your mother well. This has been my circuit for a number of years, and although we're often sent out on different routes, we become familiar with the villages along the King's roads.</p><p>``Your mother wasn't the mayor, but she was the center of Riverend. I never met a woman with a cannier sense of the dangers of living in such an isolated place--and I grew up a few towns off the Holderkin, so I'm aware of just how dangerous those fringes can be.</p><p>``But your mother had a great love for your father, and for the lands that produced him. And she had a gift, as well, a... clear understanding of people.'' She hesitated, and Kayla felt it again, that low current beneath the words that seemed to move in a different direction from their surface. ``A clearer understanding than perhaps most of us have.'' She waited.</p><p>Carris said nothing, but he did clear his throat.</p><p>``We've brought a few things that the village will find useful,'' he said at last, looking to just one side of her face, as if his dark and graceful gaze had become suddenly awkward. ``Magda often asked for aid for the rough times, and--and--she made it clear what was needed. There are medical herbs and unguents here, there are potions as well; there are bandages and cleansing herbs, as well as honest tea. There's salted, dried meat in the second bag; a lot of it, which might help. The harvest in the mainland has been... poor this year. There's also some money in the last bag.''</p><p>``You shouldn't be telling me this,'' Kayla said quietly. ``You should talk to Widow Davis; she's the mayor hereabouts, or what passes for one. She'll know what to do, and she'll be very grateful to you both.''</p><p>They exchanged another glance.</p><p>``Well, then, maybe you'd better call for the Widow Davis after all.''</p><p>Kayla smiled politely. ``If you think she isn't already on her way, you don't know Riverend all that well.''</p><p></p><p>But Kayla knew something was wrong.</p><p>The Widow Davis did, indeed, arrive; she scattered the children with a sharp inquiry about the current state of their chores, and an even sharper glance at the children who had the temerity to tell her they wanted to stay with the Companions, and then eyed the saddlebags the Heralds carried with an obvious, and deep, suspicion.</p><p>``Kayla, go mind the children. If you can't teach them to heed their duties, no one can. I'll deal with the strangers.''</p><p>Kayla felt her jaw go slack, but she hid the surprise that had caused it as she nodded to the widow and retreated. These were Heralds, not medicants, and she had never heard the Widow Davis be rude to a Herald before. She was glad that the children had been sent back to their work.</p><p>She did not see the Heralds leave, but when she had time to glance outside again, they were gone, the white of their uniforms, and the white of Companion coats, little glimpses into the heart of winter, a hint of the future.</p><p>And when she at last tucked in for bed, she fought sleep with a kind of dread that she hadn't felt since she had slept in the arms of her own mother, at a time of life so far removed it seemed centuries must have passed. The nightmares had been strong then; they were strong now.</p><p>Many of the village children dreamed. They found a place in her lap when they wished to make sense of all the things that occurred only after they closed their eyes, and she had spent years listening, with both wonder and envy, to the hundreds of broken stories that occupied their dreamscapes.</p><p>Not so her own.</p><p></p><p>She had two dreams.</p><p>There was a black dream and a white dream, set against the mountain's winter.</p><p>As a child, the black dreams were frightening, bewildering; she would wake from sleep to search for her mother; it never took long. Her mother would come, precious candle burning, and sit by the side of her bed.</p><p>``What did you dream of, Kayla?''</p><p>``The dragon.''</p><p>She had never seen a dragon; the stories that the old wives told described them as terrible, ancient beasts who had long since vanished from the face of the free lands. Books in the hold were so rare they were seldom seen, and books with pictures tipped in were rarer still.</p><p>But there was something in the shape of shadow that reminded her of those pictures.</p><p>``What was he doing?''</p><p>``Crying.''</p><p>``Ah. Try not to listen to carefully, Kayla. Dragon tears are a terrible thing.''</p><p>``I think... he's lonely.''</p><p>Her mother's smile was shallow, even by candlelight. ``Dragons are lonely; they sit on their cold, cold gold, their hard jewels, and they never come out to play.''</p><p>``He would,'' she would tell her mother, ``if he could find us.''</p><p>``I think it best that he never find us, Kayla. Riverend is no place for such a creature.''</p><p></p><p>The white dreams were different.</p><p>The snows were clearer and cleaner, and the pines that guarded the pass stretched beyond them to cut moonlight and hide it. But the light was strong enough to see by, and she always saw the same thing: the white horse.</p><p>He was the color of snow, of light on snow. And in the hold, in this place just one edge of rock and mountain, where spring came and went so quickly and summer's stretch was measured in weeks, snow was the color of death. Even as a child, she had understood that.</p><p>He did not speak to her until her father died.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>What We Have Done: An Oral History of the Disability Rights Movement</h2><p>"Nothing about us without us" has been a core principle of American disability rights activists for more than half a century. It represents a response by people with disabilities to being treated with scorn and abuse or as objects of pity, and to having the most fundamental decisions relating to their lives&#x2015;where they would live; if and how they would be educated; if they would be allowed to marry or have families; indeed, if they would be permitted to live at all&#x2015;made by those who were, in the parlance of the movement, "temporarily able-bodied."<br><br>In <i>What We Have Done: An Oral History of the Disability Rights Movement</i>, Fred Pelka takes that slogan at face value. He presents the voices of disability rights activists who, in the period from 1950 to 1990, transformed how society views people with disabilities, and recounts how the various streams of the movement came together to push through the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the most sweeping civil rights legislation since passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Beginning with the stories of those who grew up with disabilities in the 1940s and '50s, the book traces how disability came to be seen as a political issue, and how people with disabilities&#x2015;often isolated, institutionalized, and marginalized&#x2015;forged a movement analogous to the civil rights, women's rights, and gay rights movements, and fought for full and equal participation in American society.</p><p>Fred Pelka is author of The <i>ABC-CLIO Companion to the Disability Rights Movement (1997) and The Civil War Letters of Charles F. Johnson, Invalid Corps (University of Massachusetts Press, 2004). He was a 2004 Guggenheim fellow.</i>"This book makes a unique and important contribution to the field of disability movement history. Featuring the words of both activist foot soldiers and movement leaders, <i>What We Have Done</i> documents how people with diverse disabilities fought against prejudice and discrimination and won landmark political and legal victories equivalent to those of the African American and other civil rights movements of twentieth-century America."&#x2015;Mary Lou Breslin, cofounder of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF)<br><br>"Oral history is our most ancient way to talk about the events of the past. No one has worked longer or harder to make the oral history of the disability rights movement come to life than Fred Pelka. With the skill of an excellent interviewer and storyteller Pelka brings the interweaving stories of disability rights activists into the spotlight and elevates their almost overlooked struggle to its just place as a great civil rights movement."&#x2015;Eric Neudel, founder of Storyline Motion Pictures and director of <i>Lives Worth Living</i><br><br>"People interested in the rights of other oppressed groups&#x2015;women, gays, and African Americans&#x2015;will be fascinated by the stories in which disability rights and the rights of other marginalized peoples converge. Readers with disabilities will discover that they, too, have a rich and storied legacy. In sum, so many need this account that no library or bookseller can afford to be without it."&#x2015;<i>ForeWord</i><br><br>"A unique and comprehensive look at the people and events surrounding the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. . . . Everyday people are profiled and given a voice. Most academic and large public libraries will want to consider purchasing this welcome addition to the works on disability matters."&#x2015;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>"The book truly is a story of disability rights as told by those involved in the movement. . . . This book is of interest to anyone who studies social movements, collective action, and activism, as well as those interested more specifically in disability rights. The accounts provided in the book shed important light on emotions, perceptions, and motivations behind action."&#x2015;<i>Mobilizing Ideas</i><br><br>"Today, most people don't think twice about the accommodations that give people with disabilities greater access to the public sphere. . . . But 50 and 60 years ago&#x2015;or even more recently&#x2015;that was hardly the case. . . . It's an epic story that Northampton writer and researcher Fred Pelka has chronicled in his new book <i>What We Have Done: An Oral History of the Disability Rights Movement</i>."&#x2015;<i>The Amherst Bulletin</i><br><br>"Because so many people are telling the story in their own words, the narrative has a vivid and poignant feel about it. The book is easy to read and well footnoted, and it contains an extensive, useful index. Recommended."&#x2015;<i>Choice</i><br><br>"The primary contribution of <i>What We Have Done</i> is as a terrific compilation of narratives that detail the complexity of the disability rights movement from many perspectives."&#x2015;<i>H-Net Reviews</i><br><br>"Through these voices, the reader is able to understand the frustration of disability rights advocates who endured institutional abuse and patronization, as well as their determination and pride in their accomplishment. As the title suggests, they are able to look back with some satisfaction on 'what we have done,' while making it clear there is more yet to do."&#x2015;<i>Oral History Review</i></p><h2>The Devil&#x2019;s Due (A Sherlock Holmes Adventure) (Book 3)</h2><p><p>After <em>Art in the Blood</em> and <em>Unquiet Spirits</em>, Holmes and Watson are back in the third of Bonnie MacBird&#x2019;s critically acclaimed Sherlock Holmes Adventures, written in the tradition of Conan Doyle himself.</p><p>It&#x2019;s 1890 and the newly famous Sherlock Holmes faces his worst adversary to date &#x2013; a diabolical villain bent on destroying some of London&#x2019;s most admired public figures in particularly gruesome ways.

A treasured source used by almost all the significant writers in the American pulp tradition &#x2014; H. P. Lovecraft, A. Merritt, Robert E. Howard, and many others &#x2014; it endures as a work of remarkable power and one of the most chillingly original books in the genre.<br>This collection reprints all the supernatural stories from <i>The King in Yellow</i>, including the grisly "Yellow Sign," the disquieting "Repairer of Reputations," the tender "Demoiselle d'Ys," and others. Robert W. Chambers' finest stories from other sources have also been added, such as the thrilling "Maker of Moons" and "The Messenger." In addition, an unusual pleasure awaits those who know Chambers only by his horror stories: three of his finest early biological science-fiction fantasies from <i>In Search of the Unknown</i> appear here as well.</p><p>The King in Yellow and The Call of Cthulhu By Robert W. Chambers H. P. Lovecraft The King in Yellow is a book of short stories by Robert W. Chambers, first published by F. Tennyson Neely in 1895. The book is named after a fictional play with the same title which recurs as a motif through some of the stories. The first half of the book features highly esteemed weird stories, and the book is described by S.T. Joshi as a classic in the field of the supernatural. There are 10 stories, the first four of which, &#34;The Repairer of Reputations&#34;, &#34;The Mask&#34;, &#34;In the Court of the Dragon&#34; and &#34;The Yellow Sign&#34;, mention The King in Yellow, a forbidden play which induces despair or madness in those who read it. &#34;The Yellow Sign&#34; inspired a film of the same name released in 2001. The Call of Cthulhu is a short story by American writer H. P. Lovecraft. Written in the summer of 1926, it was first published in the pulp magazine Weird Tales, in February 1928. Cthulhu Mythos scholar Robert M. Price claims the irregular sonnet The Kraken, written in 1830 by Alfred Tennyson, is a major inspiration for Lovecraft&#39;s story, as both reference a huge aquatic creature sleeping for an eternity at the bottom of the ocean and destined to emerge from his slumber in an apocalyptic age.</p><h2>Breathing Room</h2><p><p>Join the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author on a journey to the sun-washed hills of Tuscany.

He's viciously handsome and sublimely talented. But as he begins his vacation in Italy, he's also vaguely dissatisfied. Being a villain with a face to die for has its rewards, but he hates the feeling that everything he's neglected in life is catching up with him. Then he spots Isabel sipping a glass of wine in a sidewalk caf�. A good guy wouldn't think of seducing such a tidy-looking woman... but he'd never seen the fun in playing the hero.</p><p>It doesn't take long for Isabel to realize she's escaped one kind of chaos only to be plunged into another. Even the shelter of a simple stone farmhouse nestled in a Tuscan olive grove can't provide her with the refuge she needs&#x2014;not when the townspeople are scheming to drive her away, and her plan to restore her reputation has come up empty.

Sparks fly, and the two are soon making up sexy scenarios while they try to solve the mystery of the digging villagers. Kate Fleming creates different voices for all the characters, allowing the listener to discern with ease who is speaking. The female voices are dead-on, adding richness to the characterizations. Even though Fleming's male voices don't ring quite true, and her children's voices sound like cartoons, the story will have the listener making up errands so as not to have to turn off the tape.

Learn from people with ASD on how to teach these skills! Edited by Stephen Shore, Ask and Tell: Self-Advocacy and Disclosure for People on the Autism Spectrum helps people with autism effectively self-advocate in their pursuit of independent, productive, and fulfilling lives. Ask and Tell is unique in that it&#39;ss the first book to speak to the twin issues of self-advocacy and disclosure for people with autism. This book also discusses how advocacy begins in preschool and extends throughout the lifespan with meaningful examples, such as showing how people with autism have great value to society. It is written and illustrated entirely by individuals with ASD, including a preface by Temple Grandin. Overall, successful self-advocacy involves a degree of disclosure about oneself that often carries some degree of risk in an effort to reach the goal of better mutual understanding. Ask and Tell offers countless practical ideas and advice adjusted for different personalities and personal preferences, and always backed by the real life experiences</p><p>Ruth Elaine Joyner Hane, lives with her husband, Jay, in Minneapolis.

Phil Schwarz is vice president of the Asperger&#39;s Association of New England (AANE), and has been a member of Autism Network International (ANI) since 1994.As soon as I opened the first pages of this book, I knew that it was going to be a great contribution for people on the autism spectrum. Of course, I was biased since I had read papers by many of its authors. I find admirable the wisdom of the answers provided in the various chapters to Phil Schwarz's question 'What mix of change in the society, as well as change in the individual, should we strive for?' Indeed, society as a whole must become more aware of autism and Asperger Syndrome, but individuals who live with these syndromes must be allowed to acquire the potential to become self-advocates too. I hope that this book will be translated into many languages. --- Paul Trehin, Vice President Autism Europe, Cagnes sur Mer, France<br><br>Self-disclosure is inherently personal - and so is this book. Written by six people on the autism spectrum, it reveals the complex perceptions and behaviors that often limit access to educational opportunities, social groups, and employment for individuals with these disorders. This remarkable text enlightens theory and gives clear instruction on the necessity for self-knowledge in achieving a better life in matters of everyday living. --- Gerald S. Fain, Ph.D., Professor, School of Education, Boston University<br><br>Finally, a book with concrete 'how-to' and 'what-to-say' advice. Here are the answers to 'what to say to other people,' written by mentors with personal experience. I like the way the authors stress how people with autism have abilities that make them different (and encourage them to be able to identify and explain their differences) from the vast majority of people they interact with. That is so much more positive than saying, 'I have autism or I have Asperger Syndrome.' --- Angela Collins, President, Autism Society of America-Greater Georgia</p><h2>Key to the Science of Theology (FIRST EDITION - 1855, with an INDEX) (Classic Reprint Series)</h2><p><p><i>"Designed as an introduction to the first principles of spiritual philosophy; religion; law and government; as delivered by the ancients, and as restored in this age, for the final development of universal peace, truth and knowledge....<br> "The present volume aims to embody, in a concise and somewhat original manner and style, a general view of the Science of Theology, as gathered from revelation, history, prophecy, reason and analogy."</i><br>&#x2014; PARLEY P.

The Games were huge, and so was the build-up: virtually the whole of the preceding year was devoted to the preparations of the site and the athletes. But these games were much more than just a sporting event: religion, power, politics, scandal, and propaganda were all at the center of the five-day festival. Held in honor of Zeus, the supreme god of Greek mythology, a visit to Olympia was also a pilgrimage to his sacred temple.</p><p>In this updated edition of her indispensable guide to the ancient Games, Judith Swaddling traces their mythological and religious origins.

Christened with the name of the great general, Irving was blessed by Washington while still a boy of seven, and later came to know many of the prominent figures of the Revolution. In these pages he describes them using firsthand source material and observation. The result is a book which is fascinating not only for its subject (the American Revolution), but also for how it reveals in illuminating detail the personality and humanity of a now remote, towering icon. Here is an intimate portrait of Washington the man, from Virginia youth to colonial commander to commander-in-chief of the patriot army to first president and great guiding force of the American federation. But one cannot read Irving's <i>Life</i> without marveling at the supreme art behind it, for his biography is foremost a work of literature. Charles Neider's abridgment and editing of Irving's long out-of-print classic has created a literary work comparable in importance and elegance to the original.<i> George Washington, A Biography</i>, Neider's title for his edition of Irving's <i>Life</i>, makes the work accessible to modern audiences. The extensive introduction provides a detailed analysis of Irving's life and times, and the difficulties he faced as he worked against his own failing health to finish what he felt was his masterpiece.

To many, the skill and craftsmanship of the builders who made them will never be forgotten. There is a talent that borders on art in creating a wooden hull from straight pieces of lumber. Steve Rogers keeps the art alive in miniature, with his beautiful models of these old wood boats. Through his work he demonstrates an appreciation for the design and construction of these boats, plus a gentle nostalgia for the times that they represent. In Model Boat Building Made Simple, Steve shares his techniques with the reader. A professional artist, Steve uses drawings and step-by-step color photographs and captions to make the process easily understood and followed. The materials needed can be bought at hobby shops, lumber yards, and hardware stores, and the tools are basic.

Disch imagines an alternate 1970s in which America has declared war on the rest of the world and much of its own citizenry and is willing to use any weapon to assure victory.&nbsp; Louis Sacchetti, a poet imprisoned for draft resistance, is delivered to a secret facility called Camp Archimedes, where he is the unwilling witness to the army's conscienceless experiments in &#x201c;intelligence maximization.&#x201d; In the experiment, Prisoners are given Pallidine, a drug derived from the syphilis spirochete, and their mental abilities quickly rise to the level of genius.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a side effect of Pallidine is death.</p><p>Thomas M. Disch is one of the overlooked masters of science fiction, and <i>Camp Concentration</i> is one of his finest novels. The unlikely hero of this piece is Louis Sacchetti, an overweight poet who's serving a five-year prison term for being a "conchie," or conscientious objector, to the ongoing war being fought by the United States. Three months into his sentence, Sacchetti is mysteriously taken from prison and brought to Camp Archimedes, an underground compound run by General Humphrey Haast. This is the so-called "camp concentration" of the book's title, a strange oubliette where inmates are given a drug that will raise their intelligence to astounding levels, though it will also kill them in a matter of months.<p> Sacchetti's job is to chronicle the goings-on at Archimedes in a daily journal that is sent to Haast and other select members of the project. Through his writings, readers get to know the various characters that inhabit the camp, geniuses whose intellectual fires burn brightly even while their bodies slowly go cold. Although these latter-day Einsteins are supposed to be thinking up new ways of killing the enemy, most of the inmates are instead focusing their studies on alchemy, which Haast hopes will allow them to discover the secret of immortality.</p><p> <i>Camp Concentration</i> is one of those SF books that falls squarely into the "literature" category both for the eloquence of Disch's writing and the timelessness of his ruminations on life and war. This is a thoughtful novel that offers insights into human existence, and it will likely stay with readers long after they have turned the last page. Ursula K. Le Guin summed up the book best in her cover blurb, which says simply: "It is a work of art, and if you read it, you will be changed." <i>--Craig E. Engler</i></p><b>Thomas M.

The Revised New Jerusalem Bible presents anew the scholarship, character and clarity of the 1966 Jerusalem Bible (the first modern English version) and the 1985 New Jerusalem Bible. It is a Bible that prioritises accuracy of translation and richness of tone, written that the message might be fully proclaimed&#39; (2 Ti 4:17). This volume presents the full New Testament and the Psalms, and a comprehensive set of study notes, cross-references and book introductions. Clear read&#39; style. The biblical scriptures were written to be proclaimed, so the RNJB uses linguistic style and speech patterns best suited for being read out loud. Formal equivalence. The language, concepts and imagery of the original scriptures are presented more accurately by the RNJB than the colloquial approach of many other modern translations. Gender inclusion. The message of the Bible is for all people, so care has been taken to avoid traditional male bias of the English language, while remaining faithful to the meaning of the original scriptures. Revised Grail Psalter. The book of Psalms is based on the text of the 2010 translation of The Revised Grail Psalms. Modern measurements. Ancient systems of measuring and timing have been replaced by modern, metric equivalents. Comprehensive study notes.

The Ramayana consists of 24,000 verses, all of which sing the praises of the great Lord Rama and his search for truth.In the verses, Rama is described as an avatar of Vishnu, however, Valmiki does not call him a God.</p><p>Subba Rao was known as the Telugu Valmiki because he translated Valmiki s Ramayana to Telugu.

("The Washington Post Book World")</p><h2>Writings on an Ethical Life</h2><p><p>Love him or hate him, you certainly can't ignore him. For the past twenty years, Australian philosopher and professor of bioethics Peter Singer has pushed the hot buttons of our collective conscience. In addition to writing the book that sparked the modern animal rights movement, Singer has challenged our most closely held beliefs on the sanctity of human life, the moral obligation's of citizens of affluent nations toward those living in the poorest countries of the world, and much more, with arguments that intrigue as often and as powerfully as they incite.</p><p><i>Writings On An Ethical Life</i> offers a comprehensive collection of Singer's best and most provocative writing, as chosen by Singer himself. Among the controversial subjects addressed are the moral status of animals, environmental account-ablility, abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, and the ultimate choice of living an ethical life. This book provides an unsurpassed one-volume view of both the underpinnings and the applications of Singer's governing philosophy.</p></p><p>Peter Singer's arguments have penetrating moral accountability that can be quite unnerving to the reader who is expecting an afternoon on the couch with a cup of coffee and a book. In fact, words like <i>influential</i>, <i>controversial</i>, and much less flattering adjectives are invariably appended to his name. There is no doubt that the first two titles apply, but whether he is deserving of the less flattering adjectives remains for readers of this book to decide. <i>Writings on an Ethical Life</i> collects his thoughts on practical ethics over the last 30 years into a single volume. Singer begins from the premise that "the whole point of ethical judgments is to guide practice," which may not seem very remarkable nowadays, but in its day was virtually anathema to academic ethicists, who preferred abstract theorizing to practical moral reasoning.<p> Singer first gained eminence for his profoundly important early work on animal rights, arguing convincingly for vegetarianism and against the commonplace cruel treatment of animals by large commercial interests. However, he has probably attracted the most notoriety for his much-maligned writings in defense of abortion rights and certain forms of euthanasia. Singer is frequently misunderstood, misquoted, and demonized. Ironically, the ferocity of his detractors--particularly during his appointment as DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University--has generated nearly unheard-of exposure for an academic philosopher. While a small portion of Singer's work has been catapulted into the limelight, lay audiences have often overlooked other equally important ideas--unfortunate, because he is a wonderfully plainspoken and powerful writer: "Where so many are in such great need, indulgence in luxury is not morally neutral, and the fact that we have not killed anyone is not enough to make us morally decent citizens of the world." It is no wonder Singer is so controversial and influential. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p><p>Peter Singer's other books include <em>Writings on an Ethical Life</em>, <em>Practical Ethics</em>, and <em>The Life You Can Save</em>, among many others. He is the Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University's Center for Human Values.</p></p><h2>The Dominion of War: Empire and Liberty in North America, 1500-2000</h2><p>Americans often think of their nation&#x2019;s history as a movement toward ever-greater democracy, equality, and freedom. Wars in this story are understood both as necessary to defend those values and as exceptions to the rule of peaceful progress. In <b>The Dominion of War</b>, historians Fred Anderson and Andrew Cayton boldly reinterpret the development of the United States, arguing instead that war has played a leading role in shaping North America from the sixteenth century to the present.<p>Anderson and Cayton bring their sweeping narrative to life by structuring it around the lives of eight men&#x2014;Samuel de Champlain, William Penn, George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, Ulysses S. Grant, Douglas MacArthur, and Colin Powell. This approach enables them to describe great events in concrete terms and to illuminate critical connections between often-forgotten imperial conflicts, such as the Seven Years&#x2019; War and the Mexican-American War, and better-known events such as the War of Independence and the Civil War. The result is a provocative, highly readable account of the ways in which republic and empire have coexisted in American history as two faces of the same coin. <b>The Dominion of War</b> recasts familiar triumphs as tragedies, proposes an unconventional set of turning points, and depicts imperialism and republicanism as inseparable influences in a pattern of development in which war and freedom have long been intertwined.&nbsp;&nbsp; It offers a new perspective on America&#x2019;s attempts to define its role in the world at the dawn of the twenty-first century.</p></p><p>"A stunning and timely book! An imaginative retelling of American history from the point of view of empire and war by two very talented historians."<br> -- Gordon S. Wood, Pulitzer Prize winning author of <i>The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin</i><br><br> "A must read in view of our present situation in the world. Anderson and Cayton take off the blinders and show us what the past is really like."<br> --Vine Deloria, Jr., author of <i>Custer Died for Your Sins</i><br><br> "This sweeping reinterpretation places war and empire where they should be - not as exceptions to the American past, but as central to it, and therefore to the United States today." <br> -- Michael Sherry, author of <i>In the Shadows of War: The United States Since the 1930s</i><br><br> "In my judgment, Fred Anderson and Andrew Cayton have given us the most important book ever written on the connection between war and American expansion. The erroneous overemphasis on American exceptionalism receives, in <i>The Dominion of War</i>, another telling body blow. Their story of American imperialism shows how much we have been like other powerful nations in history. It should be required reading for our political leaders today as they grapple with the consequences of American overstretch."<br><br> -- Don Higginbotham, Dowd Professor of History, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and author of <i>The War of American Independence</i><br>Fred Anderson is professor of history at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Still, wolves and people have been drawn to each other since the beginning. <i>Canis lupus</i> bounds through our folklore, howls in our dreams, and--occasionally--competes with us on the hunt. As one zoologist imagines it: "Through the cold of winter the wolf made music in the mysterious darkness and sometimes, in curiosity, sat just beyond the dwindling circle of firelight and watched." The curiosity was mutual; this is the feared animal, ironically, that gave rise to man's best friend. Yet only recently has science begun to understand these complex social mammals. Enter biologist L. David Mech. Years of research during the 1960s in Michigan's Isle Royale National Park provided Mech with a level of firsthand knowledge shared by few in the field. In 1970 he compiled his findings (updated in 1980) into the preeminent document of its kind. Thomas McNamee, author of <i>The Return of the Wolf to Yellowstone</i>, calls the book the "best single source of information on wolf biology," and refers to its author as "the undisputed king of wolf research." When government officials in the early 1990s decided to embark on an ambitious project to reintroduce wolves into their former range of Yellowstone National Park, they called on Mech's expertise. All this is to say that, if you want to learn about wolves, you cannot ignore this seminal work or its author. Chapters cover wolf evolution, range, and physiology; society and pack behavior; reproduction; hunting and predator-prey relationships; and the species' uncertain future. Like any self-respecting scientist, Mech includes all the hard data, but he presents his work in an engaging manner that is accessible to a broader audience, drawing heavily on anecdotes and personal experience. <p> "Many people strongly dislike the wolf," Mech writes, "others rush to its defense. But no one denies that the animal is strong, powerful, intelligent, keen, and dynamic." While persecution by man has severely restricted its current status, the tide is turning, thanks to education and conservation efforts. After all, a night without a howl echoing somewhere across the landscape would surely be a colder, less alive night. <i>--Langdon Cook</i></p>&#39;A fine, comprehensive survey of the ecology and habits of the wolf - his food, habitat, hunting, mating, social behavior and much more.

The walls were melting, caving in on him, moving again in eerie undulating motions, each wave drawing closer to him, causing him to fear that he might be sucked into the plaster at any moment. His brain felt as though it had been immersed in battery acid and now threatened to explode. His skin crawled. A thousand mosquitoes and spiders chewed on his body at the same time. He flinched and jerked uncontrollably. Loud voices from invisible people screamed at him from every angle, the irritating cacophony sounding like fingernails scraping across a chalkboard; other voices whispered heinously behind him at even a moment of quiet respite.</i></p> <p><i>He covered his ears with his hands, but the voices easily penetrated his palms. Indeed, the voices were already in his ears, inside his head, in his heart and soul. They threatened to maim and kill him, and at times, he wished they would.</i></p> <p><i>Drug addiction had been bad enough; alcoholism had wracked his young body as well. But this was different. This was hell. Now the demons attacked his mind with a vengeance. All mental acuity acquiesced to the schizophrenia.</i></p> <p><i>He tried to call out for help, but his parched tongue refused to cooperate. His voice died in his throat. Any sounds that managed to escape his mouth formed no sentences but dissolved into gibberish. Despair flooded over him again as it had so many times during the past several months he'd been in this room. He glanced around in a paranoid frenzy. He knew they'd be coming for him soon. The doctors. The nurses. Psychiatrists examined him daily, peering at him intensely as though he were a wild animal in a zoo. Nurses pumped his body full of drugs that were supposed to ease his anxiety, but none ever did. Instead he simply stared straight ahead, eyes wide open in a catatonic state.</i></p> <p><i>When he calmed down enough to listen, he heard the doctors' and nurses' terse, fearful whispers. 'He will never be well. He is going to be like this for the rest of his life. The best thing we can do for him is to keep him on strong medications. Maybe with some luck and some occupational therapy, he may be able hold down a job someday. Assuming he doesn't kill himself or overdose first.'</i></p> <p>A hopeless case.</p> <p>Written off by the medical and psychiatric community. After all, they had done their best to help him, and their best efforts simply weren't good enough.</p> <p>He would never amount to anything.</p> <p>But he did.</p> <p>How do I know?</p> <p>Because I am that young man.</p> <p>My name is Michael Cartwright. Don't tell me that you can't get free of drugs or alcohol or any other addiction, or that you will never be healthy and 'normal' again. I know you can get well. And I will show you how.</p> <p><b>A Tool You Can Really Use</b></p> <p>Someone you know desperately needs this book.</p> <p>Do you know a person who is leading an emotionally damaged, pain-filled life, and pretending that he or she <i>chooses</i> to live that way? Do you know someone who is dealing with an addiction or alcoholism, struggling with a weight problem, or trying to overcome some sort of compulsive behavior?</p> <p>I do. Most of us do. Maybe that person we know . . . is <i>you</i>.</p> <p>As my Grandma Cartwright used to say, 'Everyone has something. Everyone has some challenge to overcome. It is how we deal with that challenge that determines our future and makes all the difference in our lives.'</p> <p>Ironically, many people who struggle with addictions or compulsive behavior patterns are not homeless, living on the streets, or sleeping on park benches or in dark alleys. They are your family members, your neighbors, or your friends. They are <i>us</i>. Many people who need profound change in their lives are living in beautiful homes, driving late-model automobiles, wearing stylish clothing, and paying for their kids to go to the best schools. By all external appearances, they seem to be leading the good life. Yet deep inside, they are controlled by compulsions they wish they could overcome. They numb their pain with alcohol, drugs, food, nicotine, excessive shopping, pornography, gambling, hoarding, and a host of other compulsive behaviors. When one method no longer brings the desired euphoria, they desperately seek something else.</p> <p>The good news is that there is hope&#x2015;<i>believable hope</i>, hope that is not a mere pipe dream, but actually leads to positive change. Thousands of women and men are leading active, joyful lives, free from the constraints of their formerly life-controlling behaviors. How did it happen?</p> <p>They found freedom by improving their mindsets and discovering believable hope.</p> <p>Whether a person is trying to get off drugs or alcohol, lose weight, overcome a persistent temptation to gamble away his life savings, turn away from pornography, or stop hoarding so much junk she can't find the floor, the key to transformation is to develop a new outlook on life. Indeed, no long-term freedom from compulsive behavior is possible without a change in a person's thinking and attitudes.</p> <p>I know this truth well. Hooked on drugs and alcohol as a teenager, I landed in a catatonic state as a patient in a psychiatric hospital for five months during my early twenties. Despite rehabilitation programs and counseling, my life continued on a downward spiral until my sweet, loving grandmother hit me between the eyes with the truth. The essential truths she impressed upon me form the foundations of this book.</p> <p>I'm not naively, pompously, or piously pontificating about 'other people's problems.' I've experienced many of these life-controlling issues as well. I empathize with you. I know how it feels to be addicted or overweight. But I'm not chained to my past anymore, and that's what gives me the confidence to encourage you&#x2015;that you, too, can be free.</p> <p>How did I transform my life? I got off drugs and alcohol by establishing a new mindset, fostered by advice from my grandmother and drawn from such classic books as Norman Vincent Peale's <i>The Power of Positive Thinking</i>; <i>Psycho-Cybernetics</i>, by Dr. Maxwell Maltz; <i>As a Man Thinketh</i>, by James Allen; <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, also known as 'The Big Book'; and dozens of other spiritually oriented works.</p> <p>I don't want to toot my own horn&#x2015;well, maybe just a little&#x2015;but it is important that you understand why I am so confident that my approach to overcoming your life challenges will work for you. By changing my mindset, I have not only been able to overcome my addictions, I have become emotionally healthy and happy as well. Once free of my own compulsive behavior, I opened a halfway house for drug- and alcohol-addicted mentally ill victims in one of the most drug-infested neighborhoods in Nashville. At twenty-seven years of age, I established Foundations Associates, and the first of several residential drug and alcohol treatment centers, through which I have helped thousands of other people plagued by compulsive behavior. I pioneered centers in various locations across the United States to address the needs of everyday people as well as high-end, celebrity-type, and executive clients. Today, as chairman of the board of American Addiction Centers, a leader in the addiction treatment community, I have renovated and reopened The Greenhouse, a luxurious, 'classic' spa property in Dallas, as well as the Desert Hope Center in Las Vegas. Additionally, I developed Fit-RX, a residential weight-loss facility and program located in Nashville. To date, thousands of people have completed rehabilitative programs at our treatment centers. Another 20,000 people contact our companies each <i>month</i> seeking information or help in dealing with some life-controlling issue.</p> <p>Now, with more than twenty years of experience in dealing with addictive behavior in both 'down and outers' and 'up and outers,' I am considered a premier addiction specialist. With my emphasis on dual diagnosis&#x2015;treating addictive behavior along with the accompanying mental/emotional issues&#x2015;our success rate has been so impressive that I was invited to testify before the U.S. Senate as an expert on substance abuse and mental health matters.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>�2012 Michael Cartwright, MA and Ken Abraham.

She lives in northern California with her husband and two daughters.<br><br>Sophie Blackall is an Australian illustrator whose books include Ruby's Wish and Meet Wild Boars. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.When Bean&#39;s teacher introduces The Amazing Book of World Records, everyone in the second grade vows to set new records. Bean tries stuffing her mouth full of straws, speed washing dishes, and screaming (with predictably disastrous results); finally, Ivy involves her friend in digging for dinosaur bones so they can become the world&#39;s youngest paleontologists. Barrows&#39; dynamic duo is as appealing here as in the first two books, and emergent readers will identify with their outrageous antics. Also intriguing are Bean&#39;s sister, Nancy (who never misses an opportunity to put down her sibling), and her ever-supportive dad, whose banana bread fixes almost any problem.

It can be a haven in which people can revitalize mind, body and soul. That's what <em>Shelter for the Spirit</em> is all about. Merging Eastern and Western spiritual traditions with a sensitivity to the demands of modern life, it provides people with usable directions for bringing a sense of peace and renewal to their homes. Whether addressing how to get rid of clutter, decorate in a way that respects your personality, clean house as a spiritual exercise or celebrate special days (and ordinary ones too), <em>Shelter for the Spirit</em> shows how the quality of attention we give to everyday acts can transform our lives. The only book of its kind, it helps all readers make their homes places in which they and their guests enjoy spending their moments.</p></p><p><p>Victoria Moran is an inspirational speaker, a certified life coach, and the author of ten books including <em>Lit from Within</em>; <em>Fat, Broke &amp; Lonely No More</em>; and the international bestseller <em>Creating a Charmed Life</em>.

Ferguson.</b> No ordinary book of memoirs concludes with the promise, 'I am with you always, even to the end of the world.' But the biography of Jesus is no mere commemoration of the departed; his promise makes the Evangelists' account a living history. "Take the Gospel record in your hands", says Hugh Martin, "and you have the means of causing you to realize Christ's presence." Whether you are burdened, anxious, failing, sorrowful, or hardened, Jesus' promise means that his perfect words come with power to people in every condition and that he is present with his people in every situation.</p> <br> <br></p><p>Hugh Martin (1822-1885) was born in Aberdeen and graduated there with highest honours in Mathematics but felt called to the Christian ministry. He became the first preacher in the new denomination of the Free Church of Scotland. He wrote Christ&#39;s Presence in the Gospel Narrative, The Athonement, and The Shadow of Calvary. Hugh Martin was described as a warm hearted theologian who was a mentor to Chalmers, Bonar, and McCheyne.&#34;Hugh Martin takes us to vantage points other authors miss or never thought of ascending. He leads us to a fuller and richer understanding of the person, ministry and sacrifice of Jesus - and with that a deeper faith and a more fervent love for him. This, then, is a work to treasure, one that repays reading and re-reading.&#34; (Sinclair B.

A beautiful and inspiring volume, <i>A Perfectly Kept House is the Sign of&nbsp;A Misspent Life</i> focuses on living well with everything that makes a house a home. If you have been influenced by the picturesquely cluttered studios of Pablo Picasso or Alexander Calder, or by the art- and book-filled house of Vanessa Bell, this unique style book will stimulate you with its creative ideas.This volume explores how real-life tastemakers (photographers, textile designers, fashion designers, writers, artists) integrate their life and interiors to live well with their passions, histories, conveniences, and inconveniences. In inspiring essays, Mary Randolph Carter muses on such key housekeeping concerns as clutter versus mess; open windows; and unmade beds. Combining practical tips with liberating philosophy&#x2014;"Don&#x2019;t scrub the soul out of your home"; "Make room for what you love"&#x2014;this volume celebrates living beautifully and happily, not messily. Lavishly illustrated with intimate photographs of different living spaces, Carter exalts in the beauty of imperfection and in living perfectly in our "imperfect" homes.

Maybe a sentence or two about some long-ago Christmas Eve. Maybe some scattered glimpses of their rapidly aging father, a man they might never really know.

Only the year before, three astronauts had burned to death in their spacecraft, and since then the Apollo program had suffered one setback after another. Meanwhile, the Russians were winning the space race, the Cold War was getting hotter by the month, and President Kennedy&#x2019;s promise to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade seemed sure to be broken. But when Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders were summoned to a secret meeting and told of the dangerous mission, they instantly signed on.</p><p>Written with all the color and verve of the best narrative non-fiction, <i>Apollo 8 </i>takes us from Mission Control to the astronaut&#x2019;s homes, from the test labs to the launch pad. The race to prepare an untested rocket for an unprecedented journey paves the way for the hair-raising trip to the moon. Then, on Christmas Eve, a nation that has suffered a horrendous year of assassinations and war is heartened by an inspiring message from the trio of astronauts in lunar orbit. And when the mission is over&#x2015;after the first view of the far side of the moon, the first earth-rise, and the first re-entry through the earth&#x2019;s atmosphere following a flight to deep space&#x2015;the impossible dream of walking on the moon suddenly seems within reach. </p><p>The full story of Apollo 8 has never been told, and only Jeffrey Kluger&#x2015;Jim Lovell&#x2019;s co-author on their bestselling book about Apollo 13&#x2015;can do it justice. Here is the tale of a mission that was both a calculated risk and a wild crapshoot, a stirring account of how three American heroes forever changed our view of the home planet.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2017:</strong> It&#x2019;s hard to believe that it&#x2019;s been almost 50 years since NASA&#x2019;s Apollo program first landed a man on the moon. Since passing decades tend to filter out everything save the highlights, that epic effort has been boiled down to a couple of missions: Apollo 11&#x2019;s triumphant landing, and the near calamity of Apollo 13, which we might not remember were it not for Tom Hanks and Ron Howard. Lost is all (or most) of the daring preamble, when the United States and the Soviet Union repeatedly swapped positions in the Space Race, recklessly shooting manned aluminum cans - packed with all the computing power of a scientific calculator - into orbit. You won&#x2019;t have to be a rocket scientist to enjoy Jeffrey Kluger&#x2019;s <em>Apollo 8</em> (though it&#x2019;s pure candy for aficionados). Kluger - who previously documented the Apollo 13 crisis with Commander Jim Lovell, also the pilot aboard Apollo 8 &#x2013; recounts the first manned mission to orbit the moon, marrying technological and historical perspectives with eyewitness accounts to spin a brisk, thrilling, and informative tale. Kluger writes, &#x201c;The Saturn V engines had only one speed, which was full speed.&#x201d; So does this book. <em>--Jon Foro, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Jeffrey Kluger</b> is the author of several books, including <i>Apollo 13</i> (originally published as <i>Lost Moon</i>) and <i>The Sibling Effect</i>.

It brings the viewer to a consideration of contradictory precepts in DeCarava&#x2019;s work that seeks resolution through tonal and structural elements within the image.<br> <br><i>Light Break</i> presents a wide-ranging selection of DeCarava&#x2019;s photographs accompanied by a preface by Zo� Whitley, an American curator based in London, and features an introduction and essay by curator and art historian Sherry Turner DeCarava. Titled &#x201c;Celebration,&#x201d; Turner DeCarava&#x2019;s essay considers the artist&#x2019;s singular poetic vision, his timeless portrayals of individuals and places, and his mastery of composition and photographic printmaking.<br> <br>&#x201c;In making photographs, as in life, DeCarava was patient. Possessing both a peerless self-awareness and acute observational skills, he knew intuitively when to wait and when to open the camera&#x2019;s shutter. In the dark room, he availed himself of these same attributes, moving with steady assurance to develop his prints so as to allow the full range of what he called his &#x201c;infinite scale of grey tones&#x201d;&#x2014;often realized at the deepest end of the spectrum&#x2014;to emerge slowly and fully.&#x201d;<br> <br>This exquisite volume showcases a dynamic range of images that underscore DeCarava&#x2019;s subtle mastery of tonal and spatial elements across a wide, fascinating array of subject matter: from the figural implications of smoke and debris to the &#x201c;shimmering mirror beneath a mother as she walks with her children in the morning light.&#x201d; These photographs express a strength of imagery&#x2014;an intent to synchronize and honor the pulse of art as an emergent signal for creative and revelatory freedom.</p><p>Over the course of six decades, American artist Roy DeCarava (1919&#x2013;2009) produced a singular collection of black-and-white photographs of modern life that combine formal acuity with an intimate and deeply human treatment of his subject matter. Grounded by a uni ed theory of the visual plane, his work displays a subtle mastery of tonal and spatial elements and devotion to the medium of photography as a means of artistic expression. DeCarava created images that carry an emotional impact in their immediate relationship to the viewer, while also revealing less-than-visible terrains. DeCarava&#x2019;s pioneering work privileged the aesthetic qualities of the medium, carrying the ability to reach the viewer as a counterpoint to the view of photography as mere chronicle or document and helping it to gain acceptance as an art form in its own right.<br><br>Sherry Turner DeCarava is an art historian, curator, and independent scholar in the fields of traditional arts and contemporary American photography.

International Communism seemed everywhere on the offensive: all of Eastern Europe was securely in the Soviet camp; America&#39;s monopoly on nuclear weapons was a thing of the past; and Mao&#39;s forces had assumed control over the world&#39;s most populous country. The story of the previous five decades was one of the worst fears confirmed, and there seemed as of 1950 little sign, at least to the West, that the next fifty years would be any less dark. In fact, of course, the century&#39;s end brought the widespread triumph of political and economic freedom over its ideological enemies.In &#34;The Cold War&#34;, John Lewis Gaddis makes a major contribution to our understanding of this epochal story. Beginning with the Second World War and ending with the collapse of the Soviet Union, he provides a thrilling account of the strategic dynamics that drove the age. Now, as Britain once more finds itself in a global confrontation with an implacable ideological enemy, &#34;The Cold War&#34; tells a story whose lessons it is vitally necessary to understand.</p><p>John Lewis Gaddis is an internationally renowned historian of the Cold War and has been called &#39;the dean of Cold War historians&#39; by The New York Times. He is the Robert A. Lovett Professor of History at Yale University, is on the advisory board of the Cold War International History Project and has served as a consultant on the CNN television documentary Cold War. He is also the author of numerous books, including The United States and the Origins of the Cold War, 1941-1947 (1972), Strategies of Containment: A Critical Appraisal of Postwar American National Security Policy (1982), We Now Know: Rethinking Cold War History (1997), The Landscape of History (2002) and Surprise, Security and the American Experience (2004). He is a 2005 winner of the US National Humanities Medal and lives in New Haven.<p><b>PROLOGUE</b></p><p><b> THE VIEW FORWARD</b></p><p>IN 1946 a forty-three-year-old Englishman named Eric Blair rented a house at the edge of the world&#x2014;a house in which he expected to die. It was on the northern tip of the Scottish island of Jura, at the end of a dirt track, inaccessible by automobile, with no telephone or electricity. The nearest shop, the only one on the island, was some twenty-five miles to the south. Blair had reasons to want remoteness. Dejected by the recent death of his wife, he was suffering from tuberculosis and would soon begin coughing up blood. His country was reeling from the costs of a military victory that had brought neither security, nor prosperity, nor even the assurance that freedom would survive. Europe was dividing into two hostile camps, and the world seemed set to follow. With atomic bombs likely to be used, any new war would be apocalyptic. And he needed to finish a novel.</p><p>Its title was <i>1984</i>, an inversion of the year in which he completed it, and it appeared in Great Britain and the United States in 1949 under Blair&#x2019;s pen name, George Orwell. The reviews, the <i>New York Times</i> noted, were &#x201c;overwhelmingly admiring,&#x201d; but &#x201c;with cries of terror rising above the applause.&#x201d;1 This was hardly surprising because <i>1984</i> evoked an age, only three and a half decades distant, in which totalitarianism has triumphed everywhere. Individuality is smothered, along with law, ethics, creativity, linguistic clarity, honesty about history, and even love&#x2014;apart, of course, from the love everyone is forced to feel for the Stalin-like dictator &#x201c;Big Brother&#x201d; and his counterparts, who run a world permanently at war. &#x201c;If you want a picture of the future,&#x201d; Orwell&#x2019;s hero Winston Smith is told, as he undergoes yet another session of relentless torture, &#x201c;imagine a boot stamping on a human face&#x2014;forever.&#x201d;2</p><p>Orwell did die early in 1950&#x2014;in a London hospital, not on his island&#x2014;knowing only that his book had impressed and frightened its first readers. Subsequent readers responded similarly: <i>1984</i> became the single most compelling vision in the post&#x2013;World War II era of what might follow it. As the real year 1984 approached, therefore, comparisons with Orwell&#x2019;s imaginary year became inescapable. The world was not yet totalitarian, but dictators dominated large parts of it. The danger of war between the United States and the Soviet Union&#x2014;two superpowers instead of the three Orwell had anticipated&#x2014;seemed greater than it had for many years. And the apparently permanent conflict known as the &#x201c;Cold War,&#x201d; which began while Orwell was still alive, showed not the slightest signs of ending.</p><p>But then, on the evening of January 16, 1984, an actor Orwell would have recognized from his years as a film reviewer appeared on television in his more recent role as president of the United States. Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s reputation until this moment had been that of an ardent Cold Warrior. Now, though, he envisaged a different future:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just suppose with me for a moment that an Ivan and an Anya could find themselves, say, in a waiting room, or sharing a shelter from the rain or a storm with a Jim and Sally, and that there was no language barrier to keep them from getting acquainted. Would they then deliberate the differences between their respective governments? Or would they find themselves comparing notes about their children and what each other did for a living? . . . They might even have decided that they were all going to get together for dinner some evening soon. Above all, they would have proven that people don&#x2019;t make wars.3</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was an unexpectedly gentle invitation for human faces to prevail over boots, dictators, and the mechanisms of war. It set in motion, in Orwell&#x2019;s year 1984, the sequence of events by which they would do so. Just over a year after Reagan&#x2019;s speech, an ardent enemy of totalitarianism took power in the Soviet Union. Within six years, that country&#x2019;s control over half of Europe had collapsed. Within eight, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&#x2014;the country that had provoked Orwell&#x2019;s great gloomy prophecy in the first place&#x2014;had itself ceased to exist.</p><p>These things did not happen simply because Reagan gave a speech or because Orwell wrote a book: the remainder of this book complicates the causation. It is worth starting with visions, though, because they establish hopes and fears. History then determines which prevail.</p><p><b> CHAPTER ONE</b></p><p><b> THE RETURN OF FEAR</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>We waited for them to come ashore. We could see their faces. They</i> <i>looked like ordinary people. We had imagined something different.</i> <i>Well, they were Americans!</i></p><p>&#x2014;LIUBOVA KOZINCHENKA,<br> Red Army, 58th Guards Division</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>I guess we didn&#x2019;t know what to expect from the Russians, but when you looked at them and examined them, you couldn&#x2019;t tell whether, you know? If you put an American uniform on them, they could have been American!</i></p><p>&#x2014;AL ARONSON,<br> U.S. Army, 69th Infantry Division1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THIS WAS THE WAY the war was supposed to end: with cheers, handshakes, dancing, drinking, and hope. The date was April 25, 1945, the place the eastern German city of Torgau on the Elbe, the event the first meeting of the armies, converging from opposite ends of the earth, that had cut Nazi Germany in two. Five days later Adolf Hitler blew his brains out beneath the rubble that was all that was left of Berlin. Just over a week after that, the Germans surrendered unconditionally. The leaders of the victorious Grand Alliance, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Josef Stalin, had already exchanged their own handshakes, toasts, and hopes for a better world at two wartime summits&#x2014;Teheran in November, 1943, and Yalta in February, 1945. These gestures would have meant little, though, had the troops they commanded not been able to stage their own more boisterous celebration where it really counted: on the front lines of a battlefield from which the enemy was now disappearing.</p><p>Why, then, did the armies at Torgau approach one another warily, as if they&#x2019;d been expecting interplanetary visitors? Why did the resemblances they saw seem so surprising&#x2014;and so reassuring? Why, despite these, did their commanders insist on separate surrender ceremonies, one for the western front at Reims, in France, on May 7th, another for the eastern front in Berlin on May 8th? Why did the Soviet authorities try to break up spontaneous pro-American demonstrations that erupted in Moscow following the official announcement of the German capitulation? Why did the American authorities, during the week that followed, abruptly suspend critical shipments of Lend-Lease aid to the U.S.S.R., and then resume them? Why did Roosevelt&#x2019;s key aide Harry Hopkins, who had played a decisive role in crafting the Grand Alliance in 1941, have to rush to Moscow six weeks after his boss&#x2019;s death to try to save it? Why for that matter, years later, would Churchill title his memoir of these events <i>Triumph and Tragedy</i>?</p><p>The answer to all of these questions is much the same: that the war had been won by a coalition whose principal members were already at war&#x2014;ideologically and geopolitically if not militarily&#x2014;with one another. Whatever the Grand Alliance&#x2019;s triumphs in the spring of 1945, its success had always depended upon the pursuit of compatible objectives by incompatible systems. The tragedy was this: that victory would require the victors either to cease to be who they were, or to give up much of what they had hoped, by fighting the war, to attain.</p><p><b> I.</b></p><p>HAD THERE really been an alien visitor on the banks of the Elbe in April, 1945, he, she, or it might indeed have detected superficial resemblances in the Russian and American armies that met there, as well as in the societies from which they had come. Both the United States and the Soviet Union had been born in revolution. Both embraced ideologies with global aspirations: what worked at home, their leaders assumed, would also do so for the rest of the world. Both, as continental states, had advanced across vast frontiers: they were at the time the first and third largest countries in the world. And both had entered the war as the result of surprise attack: the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which began on June 22, 1941, and the Japanese strike against Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which Hitler used as an excuse to declare war on the United States four days later. That would have been the extent of the similarities, though. The differences, as any terrestrial observer could have quickly pointed out, were much greater.</p><p>The American Revolution, which had happened over a century and a half earlier, reflected a deep distrust of concentrated authority. Liberty and justice, the Founding Fathers had insisted, could come only through constraining power. Thanks to an ingenious constitution, their geographical isolation from potential rivals, and a magnificent endowment of natural resources, the Americans managed to build an extraordinarily powerful state, a fact that became obvious during World War II. They accomplished this, however, by severely restricting their government&#x2019;s capacity to control everyday life, whether through the dissemination of ideas, the organization of the economy, or the conduct of politics. Despite the legacy of slavery, the near extermination of native Americans, and persistent racial, sexual, and social discrimination, the citizens of the United States could plausibly claim, in 1945, to live in the freest society on the face of the earth.</p><p>The Bolshevik Revolution, which had happened only a quarter century earlier, had in contrast involved the embrace of concentrated authority as a means of overthrowing class enemies and consolidating a base from which a proletarian revolution would spread throughout the world. Karl Marx claimed, in the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> of 1848, that the industrialization capitalists had set in motion was simultaneously expanding and exploiting the working class, which would sooner or later liberate itself. Not content to wait for this to happen, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin sought to accelerate history in 1917 by seizing control of Russia and imposing Marxism on it, even though that state failed to fit Marx&#x2019;s prediction that the revolution could only occur in an advanced industrial society. Stalin in turn fixed that problem by redesigning Russia to fit Marxist-Leninist ideology: he forced a largely agrarian nation with few traditions of liberty to become a heavily industrialized nation with no liberty at all. As a consequence, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was, at the end of World War II, the most authoritarian society anywhere on the face of the earth.</p><p>If the victorious nations could hardly have been more different, the same was true of the wars they had fought from 1941 to 1945. The United States waged separate wars simultaneously&#x2014;against the Japanese in the Pacific and the Germans in Europe&#x2014;but suffered remarkably few casualties: just under 300,000 Americans died in all combat theaters. Geographically distant from where the fighting was taking place, their country experienced no significant attacks apart from the initial one at Pearl Harbor. With its ally Great Britain (which suffered about 357,000 war deaths), the United States was able to choose where, when, and in what circumstances it would fight, a fact that greatly minimized the costs and risks of fighting. But unlike the British, the Americans emerged from the war with their economy thriving: wartime spending had caused their gross domestic product almost to double in less than four years. If there could ever be such a thing as a &#x201c;good&#x201d; war, then this one, for the United States, came close.</p><p>The Soviet Union enjoyed no such advantages. It waged only one war, but it was arguably the most terrible one in all of history. With its cities, towns, and countryside ravaged, its industries ruined or hurriedly relocated beyond the Urals, the only option apart from surrender was desperate resistance, on terrain and in circumstances chosen by its enemy. Estimates of casualties, civilian and military, are notoriously inexact, but it is likely that some 27 million Soviet citizens died as a direct result of the war&#x2014;roughly <i>90 times</i> the number of Americans who died. Victory could hardly have been purchased at greater cost: the U.S.S.R. in 1945 was a shattered state, fortunate to have survived. The war, a contemporary observer recalled, was &#x201c;both the most fearful and the proudest memory of the Russian people.&#x201d;2</p><p>When it came to shaping the postwar settlement, however, the victors were more evenly matched than these asymmetries might suggest. The United States had made no commitment to reverse its long-standing tradition of remaining aloof from European affairs&#x2014;Roosevelt had even assured Stalin, at Teheran, that American troops would return home within two years after the end of the war.3 Nor, given the depressing record of the 1930s, could there be any assurance that the wartime economic boom would continue, or that democracy would again take root beyond the relatively few countries in which it still existed. The stark fact that the Americans and the British could not have defeated Hitler without Stalin&#x2019;s help meant that World War II was a victory over fascism only&#x2014;not over authoritarianism and its prospects for the future.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Soviet Union had significant assets, despite the immense losses it had suffered. Because it was part of Europe, its military forces would not be withdrawing from Europe. Its command economy had shown itself capable of sustaining full employment when the capitalist democracies had failed, during the prewar years, to do so. Its ideology enjoyed widespread respect in Europe because communists there had largely led the resistance against the Germans. Finally, the disproportionate burden the Red Army had borne in defeating Hitler gave the U.S.S.R. a moral claim to substantial, perhaps even preponderant, influence in shaping the postwar settlement. It was at least as easy to believe, in 1945, that authoritarian communism was the wave of the future as that democratic capitalism was.</p><p>The Soviet Union had one other advantage as well, which was that it alone among the victors emerged from the war with tested leadership. Roosevelt&#x2019;s death on April 12, 1945, had catapulted his inexperienced and ill-informed vice president, Harry S. Truman, into the White House. Three months later, Churchill&#x2019;s unexpected defeat in the British general election made the far less formidable Labour Party leader, Clement Attlee, prime minister. The Soviet Union, in contrast, had Stalin, its unchallenged ruler since 1929, the man who remade his country and then led it to victory in World War II. Crafty, formidable, and to all appearances calmly purposeful, the Kremlin dictator knew what he wanted in the postwar era. Truman, Attlee, and the nations they led seemed much less certain.</p><p><b> II.</b></p><p>SO WHAT <i>did</i> Stalin want? It makes sense to start with him, because only he of the three postwar leaders had had the time, while retaining the authority, to consider and rank his priorities. Sixty-five at the end of the war, the man who ran the Soviet Union was phy...</p></p><h2>Freedom of the Will</h2><p>Considered by many to be the greatest book by enormously influential American preacher and theologian JONATHAN EDWARDS (1703-1758), this provocative 1754 work explores the necessity of God&#39;s grace for the salvaging of the damaged &#34;will&#34; of humanity and argues that free will is an extension of and connected to the grace of God. What is the nature of morality? Can God be evil? What constitutes sin? How does God&#39;s foreknowledge of all events impact concepts of morality? How does intent inform our acts of vice and virtue? Still controversial and hotly debated in the 21st century, this demanding evangelistic work-some call it the best argument for the sovereignty of God-is among the essential reading of the thinker whose philosophies inspired the 18th-century religious of the Great Awakening, which continues to hugely influence American Protestantism to this day. Freedom of the Will will enthrall and challenge serious readers of the Bible as well as students of theology&#39;s impact on American history.</p><p>It is appropriate that Freedom of the Will should appear as Volume 1, for although it is not the first in the Edwards chronology, it is the work through which his fame has been most widely spread abroad, even to the multitudes who have known the book only by hearsay.Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) is by far the best known American theologian. After graduating from and teaching at Yale University, he began a very fruitful ministry at Northampton, MA. The church was the scene of the explosive revival of 1734, 35, and burned fiercely for God under Edwards for several years. Edwards then went to pastor the lowly Indians. But at last he was called to be the first president of Princeton University, where he served only 5 weeks, dying of smallpox.</p><h2>Homeopathy: The Complete Guide to Natural Remedies</h2><p><b>A comprehensive reference on the increasingly popular subject of homeopathy, written by two world-renowned experts and filled with natural cures for what ails you.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Want to ease sickness and pain without drugs or invasive procedures?

Sansom</b>&nbsp;is the author of the bestselling Shardlake series.&nbsp;The high chandeliers in the Great Hall of Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn were ablaze with candles, for it was late afternoon when the play began. Most members of Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn were present, the barristers in their robes and their wives in their best costumes. After an hour standing watching, my back was starting to ache, and I envied the few elderly and infirm members who had brought stools.<br><br>The performance of a play at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, traditionally held in March, had been cancelled earlier in the month because of heavy snow; late in the month now, it was still unseasonably cold, the breath of actors and audience visible, wafting up like smoke to the high roofbeams. The play that year was a new Interlude, <i>The Trial of Treasure</i>, a heavy-handed moral fable with the gorgeously robed actors portraying the vices and virtues of mankind. As the actor playing Virtue, resplendent in pale robes and a long, white, false beard, lectured Dissimulation on his deceitful ways &#x2014; appropriately, perhaps, to an audience of lawyers &#x2014; my attention wandered. I cast my eyes over the shadowed faces of the audience. Treasurer Rowland, a thin-faced, acerbic old man, was eyeing the actors as though wondering whether it might have been better hiring a troupe with less expensive costumes even if this play required no elaborate scenery. Across from me I saw my old enemy Stephen Bealknap, his greedy pale blue eyes studying his fellow lawyers. Those eyes were never still, would never meet yours, and as he saw me looking at him his gaze slid away. He was perhaps the crookedest lawyer I had ever come across; it still smarted that eighteen months before I had been forced to abandon a case against him through the ruthless machinations of his patron, Richard Rich. It struck me that he looked tired, ill.<br><br>Some distance away my friend Roger Elliard, to whose house I was invited to a dinner afterwards, held his wife&#x2019;s hand. A new scene had begun; Lust had made a pact of fellowship with Inclination To Evil. Embracing him, Lust was suddenly seized with pain and crouched on his knees.<br><br>Out alas, what sudden passion is this,<br>I am so taken that I cannot stand,<br>the cramp, the cramp has touched me,<br>I shall die without remedy now out of hand.<br><br>The actor, struck down by divine judgement, stretched out a trembling hand to the audience. I saw Bealknap look at him with a sort of puzzled contempt; Roger, though, turned suddenly away. I knew why; I would talk to him later.<br><br>At last the play ended; the players bowed, the audience clapped, and we got our cold limbs into motion and stepped out into Gatehouse Court. The sun was just setting, illuminating the redbrick buildings and the melting snow in the courtyard with an umber light. People walked away to the gate, or if they lived at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn stepped homewards, wrapping their coats around them. I waited in the doorway for the Elliards, nodding to acquaintances. The audience were the only ones abroad, for it was a Saturday out of law term, Palm Sunday Eve. I looked across to the Elliards&#x2019; lodgings. All the windows were lit and servants could be seen within, bustling with trays. Dorothy&#x2019;s dinners were well known around the Inn, and even at the end of Lent, with red meat forbidden, I knew that she would have large tabling and good belly cheer for the group they had invited.<br><br>Despite the cold I felt relaxed, more peaceful than I had for a long time. In just over a week it would be Easter Sunday, and also the twenty-fifth of March, the official start of the New Year of 1543. Sometimes in recent years I had wondered at this time what grim events the coming year might bring. But I reflected that now I had only good and interesting work, and times with good friends, to look forward to. That morning while dressing I had paused to study my face in the steel mirror in my bedroom; something I seldom did, for the sight of my humped back still distressed me. I saw streaks of grey in my hair, deepening lines on my face. Yet I thought perhaps they gave me something of a distinguished look; and I had passed forty the previous year, I could no longer expect to look young.<br><br>That afternoon, before the performance, I had walked down to the Thames, for I had heard the ice was breaking up at last after the long, bitter winter. I stood at Temple Stairs and looked down at the river. True enough, huge chunks of ice tumbled against each other with great crashes and creaks amid roiling grey waters. I walked back through soft, melting snow, thinking that perhaps spring was coming at last.<br><br>Standing in the doorway of the Hall, I shivered suddenly despite my heavy fur-lined coat, for though the air was definitely warmer today it was still chill and I had never put back the flesh I lost in my bad fever eighteen months before. I jumped slightly as someone clapped me on the shoulder. It was Roger, his slim form swathed in a heavy coat. Beside him his wife Dorothy, her plump cheeks red with cold, smiled at me. Her brown hair was gathered under a round French hood set with pearls.<br><br>&#x2018;You were in a brown study, Matthew,&#x2019; Roger said. &#x2018;Reflecting on the high moral sentiments of the play?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;High as a house but heavy as a horse,&#x2019; Dorothy said.<br><br>&#x2018;That they were,&#x2019; I agreed. &#x2018;Who chose it?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;The Treasurer.&#x2019; Roger looked to where Rowland was talking to an ancient judge, nodding his head gravely. Roger lowered his voice. &#x2018;He wanted something that wasn&#x2019;t politically contentious. Wise in these days. But an Italian comedy would have been better.&#x2019;<br><br>We walked across the courtyard together. I noticed the snow on the Gatehouse Court fountain, which had been frozen this last three months, was almost gone, revealing patches of grey ice. Soon perhaps the fountain would be working again, its gentle plashing sounding across the court. A few coins were exposed on the ice; even with the fountain frozen people still threw money in with a prayer for victory in a case or luck in an affair of the heart; for though they might deny it, lawyers were as superstitious as other men.<br>Roger&#x2019;s steward, an old man called Elias who had been with the family for years, greeted us at the door and took me upstairs to wash my hands. Then I went into the parlour, where fat candles cast a warm buttery light on the chairs and cushions. A dozen guests, all barristers and their wives, already sat or lounged, served with wine by Elias and a boy. A roaring fire warmed the room, bringing sweet smells from the scented herbs on the wooden floor, its light glinting on the silverware on the cloth-covered table. The walls were decorated with framed portraits in the new fashion, mostly of biblical characters. Above the large fireplace stood one of the best pieces of furniture in Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, Roger&#x2019;s pride and joy. It was a large, carved wooden frieze of intricate design, the branches of trees in full leaf interlaced with flowers and fruits, the heads of animals peering through, deer and boar and even a unicorn. Roger stood beside it, talking to Ambrose Loder from my chambers. His slim form was animated, his fine hands waving as he made some point to the plump barrister, who stood immobile, a sceptical look on his red face.<br><br>Dorothy stood beside him, wearing an expression of good-natured amusement, her colourful clothes a contrast to the black robes of the two lawyers. She wore a green damask dress with gold piping down the front, and a high collar open at the throat; it suited her well. Seeing me, she excused herself and came across.<br><br>I had known Dorothy near twenty years. She was the daughter of a serjeant in my first chambers. We had both been in our early twenties then and I had at once been attracted to Dorothy&#x2019;s elegance, wit and kind nature &#x2014; a rare combination. She seemed to like my company too, never seemed to mind my bent back, and we became good friends. After a while I dared to think of trying to turn friendship into something more. I had given no signs of my real feelings, though, and therefore had only myself to blame when I learned that Roger, my friend and colleague, had already proposed marriage and been accepted. He later said &#x2014; and I believed him &#x2014; that he had not realized my feelings for Dorothy. She had guessed, though, and tried to sweeten the pill by saying she had had a difficult choice to make. I had found that hard to believe, for Roger was handsome as well as clever, with a quicksilver, energetic grace to his movements.<br><br>Dorothy was, like me, past forty now; though apart from little wrinkles visible around her eyes she looked a good deal younger. I bent and kissed her on her full cheeks.<br><br>&#x2018;A merry Palm Sunday to you, Dorothy.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And to you, Matthew.&#x2019; She squeezed my hand. &#x2018;How is your health?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Good these days.&#x2019; My back had often given me trouble, but these last months I had been conscientious in the exercises my physician friend Guy had prescribed, and had felt much better.<br><br>&#x2018;You look well.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And you look younger each New Year, Dorothy. May this one bring peace and prosperity.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I hope so. Though there has been a strange portent, have you heard? Two huge fish washed up by the Thames. Great grey things half the size of a house. They must have been under the ice.&#x2019; The twinkle in her eyes told me she found the story, like so much in the world, delightfully absurd.<br><br>&#x2018;Were they alive?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No. They lie on the mudbanks over at Greenwich. People have been crossing London Bridge in hundreds to see them.

Her M�tis family has lived in their tightly knit rural community for generations, but no one keeps the old ways . . . until they have to. That moment has arrived for Joan.</p><p>One morning, grieving and severely hungover, Joan hears a shocking sound coming from inside a revival tent in a gritty Walmart parking lot. It is the unmistakable voice of Victor. Drawn inside, she sees him. He has the same face, the same eyes, the same hands, though his hair is much shorter and he's wearing a suit. But he doesn't seem to recognize Joan at all. He insists his name is Eugene Wolff, and that he is a reverend whose mission is to spread the word of Jesus and grow His flock. Yet Joan suspects there is something dark and terrifying within this charismatic preacher who professes to be a man of God . . . something old and very dangerous.</p><p>Joan turns to Ajean, an elderly foul-mouthed card shark who is one of the few among her community steeped in the traditions of her people and knowledgeable about their ancient enemies. With the help of the old M�tis and her peculiar Johnny-Cash-loving, twelve-year-old nephew Zeus, Joan must find a way to uncover the truth and remind Reverend Wolff who he really is . . . if he really is.

A powerful, groundbreaking contemporary classic, <i>The Street Kids</i>&nbsp;is now available in a new translation by Ann Goldstein, translator of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Novels.&nbsp;<br><br>Set in Rome during the post-war years, the Rome of the "borgate," outlying neighborhoods beset by poverty and deprivation, <i>The Street Kids</i> tells the story of a group of adolescents belonging to the urban underclass. Living hand-to-mouth, Riccetto and his friends eek out an existence doing odd jobs, committing petty crimes and prostituting themselves. Rooted in the neorealist movement of the 1950s, <i>The Street Kids</i> is a tender, heart-rending tribute to an entire social class in danger of being forgotten.&nbsp;<br><br>Pasolini's novel was heavily censored, criticized by professional critics, and lambasted by much of the general public upon its publication. But its undeniable force and vitality eventually led to it being universally acknowledged as a masterpiece.</p><p><b>Pier Paolo Pasolini </b>was born in 1922. He was an Italian film director, poet, writer, and intellectual. Throughout his life he exhibited extraordinary cultural versatility and became a highly controversial figure in the process. While his work remains controversial, since his death in 1975, Pasolini has come to be seen as a visionary thinker and a major figure in italian literature and art. American literary critic Harold Bloom considered Pasolini to be a major 20th-century poet and included his works in his collection of the Western Canon.<br><br><b>Ann Goldstein</b> is an editor at <i>The New Yorker</i>.

She has also authored many articles on the people and places of the American West. Her work has won national and regional awards. Her first John O'Malley mystery, <b>The Eagle Catcher</b>, was a national bestseller, garnering excellent reviews from the <b>Denver Post</b>, Tony Hillerman, Jean Hager, Loren D. Estleman, Stephen White, Earlene Fowler, Ann Ripley and other top writers in the field. A native of Colorado, she resides in Boulder.Starred Review. Coel introduces a tenacious heroine, Denver investigative reporter Catherine McLeod, in this stellar first in a new series. After an attempt on her life, Catherine realizes she was far from a random target when Arapaho elder Norman Whitehorse informs her that she's one of us. Adopted as a child and still unsure of her identity and heritage, Catherine begins to understand the deep connection she feels to her latest story, about the 1864 Indian massacre at Sand Creek. Whitehorse and Cheyenne leaders call for the tribes' further compensation for Sand Creek, but when Catherine starts digging, she realizes that there's more to the land fight than meets the eye, and the trail leads all the way to Washington. With a killer hot on her heels and his collateral damage accumulating, Catherine hurtles toward a conclusion that's both fitting and unanticipated. A cameo appearance by Coel's usual leading lady, Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden (<i>The Girl with Braided Hair</i>, etc.), hints at a much welcome future collaboration between these two crime-solving women. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I don&#x2019;t know when I&#x2019;ve been so thrilled.&#x201d; Meadow Downey gave a most un-Meadow-like squeal to emphasize the point. She waved a hand to express her excitement and knocked her red-framed glasses askew in the process. Her long gray braid swished from side to side, punctuating her enthusiasm.</p><p>Her friend Beatrice Coleman repressed a wide smile as she pushed back a strand of platinum hair from her face. But she couldn&#x2019;t hold back a grin. &#x201c;Especially when it&#x2019;s not one&#x2019;s own.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, but for you it&#x2019;s practically a family wedding,&#x201d; continued Meadow. &#x201c;Wyatt&#x2019;s sister is finally tying the knot after fifty years. It&#x2019;s all very exciting.&#x201d;</p><p>Meadow and Beatrice were following up on Meadow&#x2019;s resolution to work in more exercise by walking their dogs through their neighborhood in the tiny mountain town of Dappled Hills, North Carolina. Now that it was April, the air had warmed enough that a morning walk required only a light sweater. The dogwoods were blooming, daffodils were waving in the breeze, and the women could feast on the view of the rolling Blue Ridge Mountains returning to vibrant life after the starkness of winter.</p><p>Meadow was wrestling with her gigantic beast, Boris, while Beatrice was taking an easy stroll with her corgi, Noo-noo. Boris was part Great Dane and part Newfoundland, which were clearly visible. It was Meadow&#x2019;s claim that Boris was also part corgi that Beatrice found doubtful. With Meadow always a couple of yards ahead of Beatrice because Boris was pulling her along at great speed, Beatrice wasn&#x2019;t sure if the walk could be considered a success. Or if it really could be termed a <i>walk</i> at all.</p><p>&#x201c;It really is,&#x201d; said Beatrice. &#x201c;Although I would hardly call it a family wedding, Meadow. I haven&#x2019;t even properly met Harper. And Wyatt and I have only just started to date. It&#x2019;s not as if we&#x2019;re married.&#x201d;</p><p>Meadow completely ignored this detail, continuing on with her line of thought and yanking back on Boris&#x2019;s halter as he tried to race off after a terrified squirrel. &#x201c;Can you imagine marrying at fifty? She must be very set in her ways, don&#x2019;t you think? It sure would be tough trying to train a man at that point in your life. Actually,&#x201d; she said in a ruminating voice, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine trying to train a man at <i>any</i> point in life. You can see what a disaster my training of Ramsay was.&#x201d;</p><p>Ramsay was Meadow&#x2019;s long-suffering husband and the police chief of Dappled Hills. He seemed very housebroken to Beatrice. Yes, he had a fondness for losing his reading glasses, writing poetry, and quoting <i>Walden</i> a bit much. But he was kind and hardworking. And even seemed to pick up after himself.</p><p>&#x201c;Harper was just waiting for the perfect match&#x2014;that&#x2019;s all. Wyatt is so happy for her. He felt terrible that she and I haven&#x2019;t met each other, so he invited Harper and her fianc� to have supper with us tonight at his house,&#x201d; said Beatrice.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you bringing to the dinner party?&#x201d; asked Meadow, a little breathlessly. Beatrice wasn&#x2019;t sure if the breathlessness was because she was always trying to persuade Beatrice to win Wyatt&#x2019;s heart through food, or the fact that Boris was pulling her along as if she were water-skiing.</p><p>Beatrice&#x2019;s already brisk walk turned into more of a jog. Noo-noo gave her a despairing look, as if her short corgi legs couldn&#x2019;t possibly keep pace. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not cooking anything,&#x201d; said Beatrice slowly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just bringing a bottle of wine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s the perfect opportunity for you to impress Wyatt with your culinary skills,&#x201d; said Meadow, disappointed. &#x201c;A bottle of wine just shows you know how to shop.&#x201d; She neatly sidestepped a puddle left by a brief spring shower earlier that morning. Meadow finally reined in Boris as he skidded to a stop to inspect a mailbox that apparently smelled fascinating. Beatrice gave a grateful sigh as she slowed to a walk and completely caught up with Meadow again. Noo-noo, tongue hanging out and panting, seemed relieved, as well.</p><p>&#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re keeping it really low-key, actually.&#x201d; Beatrice shrugged. &#x201c;And my culinary skills are nothing to brag about, as you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A low-key dinner party?&#x201d; asked Meadow. She sounded a bit scandalized.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not even a <i>dinner party</i>. It&#x2019;s really just supper. That way I can meet Harper and her fianc� and we can have a nice evening together.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s a little odd that you haven&#x2019;t been introduced to Harper before now. After all, she does go to church quite a bit,&#x201d; said Meadow.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m still pretty new to town, you know. Besides, I don&#x2019;t know everyone who goes to church, and there was no real reason for Wyatt to have introduced me to his sister before we started dating. Harper doesn&#x2019;t live in town, anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t, but she doesn&#x2019;t live far from Dappled Hills, either. Just let me know how it goes,&#x201d; said Meadow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m curious about Harper&#x2019;s fianc�, Daniel. I know he grew up here, but he was gone for so long. It&#x2019;s been ages since I&#x2019;ve last seen him. I remember him as a serious kid. He&#x2019;s younger than I am, and the same age as my youngest sister. He was very smart and kind of quiet. The kind of kid who always had good manners when speaking with adults. He&#x2019;s a lawyer, isn&#x2019;t he? Not that we don&#x2019;t have enough of those around town.&#x201d; Meadow rolled her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;He is, but I think he works pro bono half the time. Daniel sounds like a good guy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, be sure to give me the scoop. I&#x2019;m interested in his best man, too&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve been hearing some gossip lately about Trevor Garber.&#x201d; Meadow waggled her eyebrows in what was supposed to be a telling manner.</p><p>&#x201c;Considering this is Dappled Hills, I can&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m surprised. Everyone seems to know everything around here. What are you hearing about Daniel&#x2019;s best man?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hear he&#x2019;s behaving sort of out of character. And there are rumors&#x201d;&#x2014;here Meadow dropped her voice into her usual loud whisper, as if someone could hear them out on the quiet road&#x2014;&#x201c;that he might be having an affair.&#x201d; Then she jerked forward abruptly as Boris took off at a full gallop again.</p><p>&#x201c;I doubt I&#x2019;ll hear much about that at supper tonight,&#x201d; said Beatrice, jogging ahead again. But you never knew. Not in Dappled Hills.</p><p>Meadow gave a gasping laugh as Boris dragged her forward. &#x201c;Do you think I&#x2019;m really getting exercise doing this? It feels like I&#x2019;m just being pulled along. If I put roller skates on, I bet I&#x2019;d end up across town in minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever you&#x2019;re doing, it&#x2019;s exertion, all right.&#x201d; Beatrice smiled ruefully as Meadow went flying forward again. Beatrice decided she and Noo-noo were done with running to catch up and instead ambled toward their friends.</p><p>Eventually Meadow was able to tighten her grip on the leash and slow Boris down to a more leisurely pace. When Beatrice caught up with them, she gave Beatrice a curious look. &#x201c;Have you been able to see much of Wyatt these past few weeks? It seems like he&#x2019;s been in charge of tons of activities at the church lately.&#x201d;</p><p>Beatrice cleared her throat. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve seen each other, yes. Maybe not as much as I&#x2019;d like to, but I understand about how busy he&#x2019;s been. And when you&#x2019;re a minister, you&#x2019;re never really off. There are always people to visit&#x2014;folks in hospitals, things like that. It&#x2019;s sort of the point of the job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing,&#x201d; said Meadow archly, giving Beatrice a sideways glance, &#x201c;that the best way for you to spend more time with him is probably by spending more time at the church. Right? Volunteering there, helping set up events, attending events. That sort of thing. After all, you&#x2019;re the one who&#x2019;s retired. So, technically, you have more free time.&#x201d;</p><p>Beatrice admired a row of azalea bushes as they walked past. She&#x2019;d have to take a more scenic walk with Noo-noo tomorrow. This one was flying by. &#x201c;Technically I <i>do</i> have more free time,&#x201d; said Beatrice. She was amazed lately how the days seemed to just disappear in a puff. Retirement was growing on her. But Meadow had a point, and it was one that Beatrice had been considering, too. The only thing that was really holding her back was the thought that a lot of extra socializing was going to be in order if she really started spending time at the church. Beatrice didn&#x2019;t mind a little socializing, but always quickly felt as though she wanted to retreat. She thought longingly of her hammock and her book.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s something to think about, anyway,&#x201d; said Meadow. She was fond of planting ideas in people&#x2019;s heads. &#x201c;Although I&#x2019;ll miss seeing you if you spend more time with Wyatt. The sacrifices I make! Well, I&#x2019;m sure tonight there&#x2019;ll be lots of talk of wedding planning. I hope it will be a beautiful wedding. Although the other night on TV, I saw this really horrifying show. It was sort of like watching a train wreck&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t seem to pull myself away from it. It was called <i>Worst Wedding Day Disasters Ever!</i> and there was everything from a typhoon to the groom not showing up and a deer running into the ceremony and charging around the sanctuary. Scary stuff!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, none of that is going to happen during Harper and Daniel&#x2019;s wedding next month. When was the last time you saw a typhoon here in North Carolina? Daniel sounds too responsible to skip out on his own wedding. And I&#x2019;ll personally ensure that the door to the sanctuary remains closed throughout the ceremony. I defy any deer to run through. It&#x2019;s going to be a lovely service.&#x201d;</p><p>Why did Beatrice feel as though she should be knocking on wood?</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Wyatt&#x2019;s house was a stone cottage very similar to Beatrice&#x2019;s. It sat on the property of Dappled Hills Presbyterian Church and had been the manse for years.</p><p>Shortly after Beatrice rang the doorbell, Wyatt&#x2019;s sister, Harper, greeted her with a warm smile and a hug in Wyatt&#x2019;s small entryway. &#x201c;I feel as if I know you already&#x2014;Wyatt has spoken so much and so highly of you, Beatrice. I&#x2019;m sorry we haven&#x2019;t met before now. I have a bad habit of sneaking into church right before the service starts and then hurrying back out afterward.&#x201d;</p><p>Harper was tall and thin like her brother, but didn&#x2019;t yet share his silver-streaked hair. She appeared to be in her early fifties and had an understated elegance about her, reflected in her crisp chinos and cotton button-down blouse with a leaf-and-dot print. She had high cheekbones and a wide, generous mouth. Beatrice followed her into a sparsely but comfortably decorated living room with thick throw rugs on the wooden floors, colorful paintings with scenes from nature, and ultrasoft sofas and armchairs.</p><p>Her fianc�, Daniel Kemp, rose to shake Beatrice&#x2019;s hand. He looked as if he had a tendency to be on the serious side, but his eyes were kind and his smile was genuine.</p><p>Beatrice took a seat next to Wyatt on a cushy, warm brown sofa. She asked Harper, &#x201c;So, how did you and Daniel meet? Did you know each other when you were children? Daniel, you are originally from Dappled Hills, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Daniel nodded, carefully adjusting his black-framed eyeglasses. &#x201c;I knew Harper growing up, but we weren&#x2019;t friends then.&#x201d;</p><p>Harper laughed. &#x201c;That sounds awful. It&#x2019;s just that Daniel seemed much, much older when we were kids. You know how it is when you&#x2019;re in school. He was two grades ahead of me, and that felt like decades. We were in the same youth group at Dappled Hills Presbyterian and saw each other there a little. Wyatt&#x2019;s and my father was the minister then, so we were at about every youth event there was. And Daniel was also there often, although he hung out with the older kids, of course. When he moved back to Dappled Hills from Charlotte, he rented a house right down the street from me, and that&#x2019;s when we finally found out how much we have in common.&#x201d;</p><p>Beatrice asked Daniel, &#x201c;What made you decide to move back home from Charlotte? It must be a huge change for you after so many years.&#x201d;</p><p>Daniel smiled at her but seemed to choose his words carefully. &#x201c;My mother lives in assisted living here and I wanted to move closer to her. And I always planned on coming back home to Dappled Hills&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because that&#x2019;s how Dappled Hills feels to me. Like home.&#x201d;</p><p>Harper quickly changed the subject, perhaps sensing that Daniel wasn&#x2019;t comfortable as the center of attention. &#x201c;Beatrice, I understand that you were an art-museum curator in Atlanta, and that you know a lot about setting up exhibits and making displays appealing. I wanted to get your thoughts on some flower arrangements I&#x2019;m making for the wedding.&#x201d; Harper&#x2019;s intelligent brown eyes gazed earnestly at her.</p><p>Daniel gave a good-natured groan. &#x201c;Wyatt, I guess this is where we bow out of the conversation. We&#x2019;ll have to talk about fly-fishing or football or some other manly activity to counteract the wedding planning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want your opinions, too! You just aren&#x2019;t as experienced in this area as Beatrice is. And, honestly, the biggest parts are already taken care of. We&#x2019;ve got the catering set up and the reception location reserved. Now I need to catch up with the decorating, and I&#x2019;m in a bit of a time crunch, since the wedding is in a month. My thought is that although I want to keep the wedding simple and traditional and low-key, I really want to incorporate quilts and quilting into the ceremony and reception&#x2014;as a tribute. You&#x2019;ve probably heard that Wyatt&#x2019;s and my mother was a member of the Village Quilters,&#x201d; added Harper.</p><p>Wyatt looked abashed and Harper said, &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t tell her?&#x201d;</p><p>Beatrice blinked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised that <i>Meadow</i> didn&#x2019;t tell me. After all, she lives and breathes the Village Quilters guild.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not only Mother, but <i>Granny</i> was also in the guild. And I have a feeling that Granny&#x2019;s mom was in it, too, but I never asked Mother. You always think you have so much time with your family, and then one day they&#x2019;re gone and you never had the chance to ask questions.&#x201d; Harper swallowed hard and then continued in a firm voice, &#x201c;So, that&#x2019;s why I want to bring quilting in. Besides, quilting has been a big part of my life, too. One of my earliest memories was of Miss Sissy guiding my hands as she showed me how to quilt my first pattern.&#x201d;</p><p>Beatrice gaped at her. &#x201c;Miss Sissy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. She&#x2019;s Wyatt&#x2019;s and my godmother.&#x201d; A pause. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me&#x2014;Wyatt didn&#x2019;t mention that to you, either?&#x201d;</p><p>Beatrice reflected on Wyatt&#x2019;s patience with the old woman, his continuing visits, and courteous kindness toward her. She should have guessed, she supposed, but he was like that with his entire church congregation.</p><p>Wyatt said, &#x201c;You know, I think I heard a timer go off in the kitchen.&#x201d; He winked at Beatrice and moved quickly toward the door. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t y&#x2019;all move into the dining room?&#x201d;</p><p>Beatrice decided to help him out by changing the subject. &#x201c;How do you want to incorporate quilting into your big day?&#x201d; she asked, as they obediently filed into the dining room and sat around a weathered pine table on farmhouse-style benches. The room was small but warm, with a rug in bright reds and blues under the table, bright lighting, and cheerful yellow paint on the walls.</p><p>Harper said, &#x201c;Oh, I was thinking about several different things. And, Beatrice, you don&#x2019;t know how excited I...</p></p><h2>Corralled: A Blacktop Cowboys Novel</h2><p><b>In the rodeo arena, all you have to worry about is surviving.

In 1935, Albert Einstein famously showed that, according to the quantum theory, separated particles could act as if intimately connected&#x2013;a phenomenon which he derisively described as &#x201c;spooky action at a distance.&#x201d; In that same year, Erwin Schr�dinger christened this correlation &#x201c;entanglement.&#x201d; Yet its existence was mostly ignored until 1964, when the Irish physicist John Bell demonstrated just how strange this entanglement really was. Drawing on the papers, letters, and memoirs of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest physicists, Gilder both humanizes and dramatizes the story by employing the scientists&#x2019; own words in imagined face-to-face dialogues. The result is a richly illuminating exploration of one of the most exciting concepts of quantum physics.</p><p>Louisa Gilder was born in Tyringham, Massachusetts, and graduated from Dartmouth College in 2000. This is her first book.Chapter 1 The Socks 1978 and 1981 In 1978, when John Bell first met Reinhold Bertlmann, at the weekly tea party at the Organisation Europ�enne pour la Recherche Nucl�aire, near Geneva, he could not know that the thin young Austrian, smiling at him through a short black beard, was wearing mismatched socks. And Bertlmann did not notice the characteristically logical extension of Bell&#x2019;s vegetarianism&#x2014;plastic shoes. Deep under the ground beneath these two pairs of maverick feet, ever-increasing magnetic fields were accelerating protons (pieces of the tiny center of the atom) around and around a doughnut-shaped track a quarter of a kilometer in diameter. Studying these particles was part of the daily work of CERN, as the organization was called (a tangled history left the acronym no longer correlated with the name). In the early 1950s, at the age of twenty-five, Bell had acted as consultant to the team that designed this subterranean accelerator, christened in scientific pseudo-Greek &#x201c;the Proton Synchrotron.&#x201d; In 1960, the Irish physicist returned to Switzerland to live, with his Scottish wife, Mary, also a physicist and a designer of accelorators. CERN&#x2019;s charmless, colorless campus of box-shaped buildings with protons flying through their foundations became Bell&#x2019;s intellectual home for the rest of his life, in the green pastureland between Geneva and the mountains. At such a huge and impersonal place, Bell believed, newcomers should be welcomed. He had never seen Bertlmann before, and so he walked up to him and said, his brogue still clear despite almost two decades in Geneva: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m John Bell.&#x201d; This was a familiar name to Bertlmann&#x2014;familiar, in fact, to almost anyone who studied the high-speed crashes and collisions taking place under Bell&#x2019;s and Bertlmann&#x2019;s feet (in other words, the disciplines known as particle physics and quantum field theory). Bell had spent the last quarter of a century conducting piercing investigations into these flying, decaying, and shattering particles. Like Sherlock Holmes, he focused on details others ignored and was wont to make startlingly clear and unexpected assessments. &#x201c;He did not like to take commonly held views for granted but tended to ask, &#x2018;How do you know?,&#x2019; &#x201d; said his professor, Sir Rudolf Peierls, a great physicist of the previous generation. &#x201c;John always stood out through his ability to penetrate to the bottom of any argument,&#x201d; an early co-?worker remembered, &#x201c;and to find the flaws in it by very simple reasoning.&#x201d; His papers&#x2014;numbering over one hundred by 1978&#x2014;were an inventory of such questions answered, and flaws or treasures discovered as a result.Bertlmann already knew this, and that Bell was a theorist with an almost quaint sense of responsibility who shied away from grand speculations and rooted himself in what was directly related to experiments at CERN. Yet it was this same responsibility that would not let him ignore what he called a &#x201c;rottenness&#x201d; or a &#x201c;dirtiness&#x201d; in the foundations of quantum mechanics, the theory with which they all worked. Probing the weak points of these foundations&#x2014;the places in the plumbing where the theory was, as he put it, &#x201c;unprofessional&#x201d;&#x2014;occupied Bell&#x2019;s free time. Had those in the lab known of this hobby, almost none of them would have approved. But on a sabbatical in California in 1964, six thousand miles from his responsibilities at CERN, Bell had made a fascinating discovery down there in the plumbing of the theory. Revealed in that extraordinary paper of 1964, Bell&#x2019;s theorem showed that the world of quantum mechanics&#x2014;the base upon which the world we see is built&#x2014;is composed of entities which are either, in the jargon of physics, not <i>locally causal,</i> not <i>fully separable</i>, or even not <i>real unless observed</i>. If the entities of the quantum world are not locally causal, then an action like measuring a particle can have instantaneous &#x201c;spooky&#x201d; effects across the universe. As for separability: &#x201c;Without such an assumption of the mutually independent existence (the &#x2018;being-?thus&#x2019;) of spatially distant things...,&#x201d; Einstein insisted, &#x201c;physical thought in the sense familiar to us would not be possible. Nor does one see how physical laws could be formulated and tested without such a clean separation.&#x201d; The most extreme version of nonseparability is the idea that the quantum entities are not independently real: that atoms do not become solid until they are observed, like the proverbial tree that makes no sound when it falls unless a listener is around. Einstein found the implications ludicrous: &#x201c;Do you really believe the moon is not there if nobody looks?&#x201d; Up to that point, the idea of science rested on separability, as Einstein had said. It could be summarized as humankind&#x2019;s long intellectual journey away from magic (not locally causal) and from anthropocentricism (not independently real). Perversely, and to the consternation of Bell himself, his theorem brought physics to the point where it seemingly had to choose between these absurdities. Whatever the ramifications, it would become obvious by the beginning of this century that Bell&#x2019;s paper had caused a sea change in physics. But in 1978 the paper, published fourteen years before in an obscure journal, was still mostly unknown. Bertlmann looked with interest at his new acquaintance, who was smiling affably with eyes almost shut behind big metal-rimmed glasses. Bell had red hair that came down over his ears&#x2014;not flaming red, but what was known in his native country as &#x201c;ginger&#x201d;&#x2014;and a short beard. His shirt was brighter than his hair, and he wore no tie. In his painstaking Viennese-inflected English, Bertlmann introduced himself: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Reinhold Bertlmann, a new fellow from Austria.&#x201d; Bell&#x2019;s smile broadened. &#x201c;Oh? And what are you working on?&#x201d; It turned out that they were both engaged with the same calculations dealing with quarks, the tiniest bits of matter. They found they had come up with the same results, Bell by one method on his desktop calculator, Bertlmann by the computer program he had written. So began a happy and fruitful collaboration. And one day, Bell happened to notice Bertlmann&#x2019;s socks. Three years later, in an austere room high up in one of the majestic stone buildings of the University of Vienna, Bertlmann was curled over the screen of one of the physics department&#x2019;s computers, deep in the world of quarks, thinking not in words but in equations. His computer&#x2014;at fifteen feet by six feet by six feet one of the department&#x2019;s smaller ones&#x2014;almost filled the room. Despite the early spring chill, the air-conditioning ran, fighting the heat produced by the sweatings and whirrings of the behemoth. Occasionally Bertlmann fed it a new punch card perforated with a line of code. He had been at his work for hours as the sunlight moved silently around the room. He didn&#x2019;t look up at the sound of someone&#x2019;s practiced fingers poking the buttons that unlocked the door, nor when it swung open. Gerhard Ecker, from across the hall, was coming straight at him, a sheaf of papers in hand. He was the university&#x2019;s man in charge of receiving preprints&#x2014;papers that have yet to be published, which authors send to scientists whose work is related to their own. Ecker was laughing. &#x201c;Bertlmann!&#x201d; he shouted, even though he was not four feet away. Bertlmann looked up, bemused, as Ecker thrust a preprint into his hands: &#x201c;You&#x2019;re famous now!&#x201d; The title, as Bertlmann surveyed it, read: <b>Bertlmann&#x2019;s Socks and the Nature of Reality</b><i> J. S. Bell</i> CERN, Geneve, Suisse The article was slated for publication in a French physics periodical, <i>Journal de Physique</i>, later in 1981. Its title was almost as incomprehensible to Bertlmann as it would be for a casual reader. &#x201c;But what&#x2019;s this about? What possibly&#x2014;&#x201d; Ecker said, &#x201c;Read it, read it.&#x201d; He read. The philosopher in the street, who has not suffered a course in quantum mechanics, is quite unimpressed by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations. He can point to many examples of similar correlations in everyday life. The case of Bertlmann&#x2019;s socks is often cited.<i> My socks? What is he talking about? And EPR correlations? It&#x2019;s a big joke, John Bell is playing a big published joke on me. </i>&#x201c;EPR&#x201d;&#x2014;short for the paper&#x2019;s authors, Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen&#x2014;was, like Bell&#x2019;s 1964 theorem, which it inspired thirty years later, something of an embarrassment for physics. To the question posed by their title, &#x201c;Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?,&#x201d; Einstein and his lesser-known cohorts answered no. They brought to the attention of physicists the existence of a mystery in the quantum theory. Two particles that had once interacted could, no matter how far apart, remain &#x201c;entangled&#x201d;&#x2014;the word Schr�dinger coined in that same year&#x2014;1935&#x2014;to describe this mystery. A rigorous application of the laws of quantum mechanics seemed to force the conclusion that measuring one particle affected the state of the second one: acting on it at a great distance by those &#x201c;spooky&#x201d; means. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen therefore felt that quantum mechanics would be superseded by some future theory that would make sense of the case of the correlated particles. Physicists around the world had barely looked up from their calculations. Years went by, and it became more and more obvious that despite some odd details, ignored like the eccentricities of a general who is winning a war, quantum mechanics was the most accurate theory in the history of science. But John Bell was a man who noticed details, and he noticed that the EPR paper had not been satisfactorily dealt with. Bertlmann felt like laughing in confusion. He looked at Ecker, who was grinning: &#x201c;Read on, read on.&#x201d; Dr. Bertlmann likes to wear two socks of different colors. Which color he will have on a given foot on a given day is quite unpredictable. But when you see (Fig. 1) that the first sock is pink...<i>What is Fig. 1? My socks? </i>Bertlmann ruffled through the pages and found, appended at the end, a little line sketch of the kind John Bell was fond of doing: But when you see that the first sock is pink you can be already sure that the second sock will not be pink. Observation of the first, and experience of Bertlmann, give immediate information about the second. There is no accounting for tastes, but apart from that there is no mystery here. And is not the EPR business just the same? Bertlmann imagined John&#x2019;s voice saying this, conjured up his amused face. <i>For three years we worked together every day and he never said a thing</i>.Ecker was laughing. &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; Bertlmann had already dashed past him, out the door, down the hall to the phone, and with trembling fingers was calling CERN. Bell was in his office when the phone rang, and Bertlmann came on the line, completely incoherent. &#x201c;What have you done? <i>What have you done?</i>&#x201d; Bell&#x2019;s clear laugh alone, so familiar and matter-?of-?fact, was enough to bring the world into focus again. Then Bell said, enjoying the whole thing: &#x201c;Now you are famous, Reinhold.&#x201d; &#x201c;But what is this paper about? Is this a big joke?&#x201d; &#x201c;Read the paper, Reinhold, and tell me what you think.&#x201d; A tigress paces before a mirror. Her image, down to the last stripe, mimics her every motion, every sliding muscle, the smallest twitch of her tail. How are she and her reflection correlated? The light shining down on her narrow slinky shoulders bounces off them in all directions. Some of this light ends up in the eye of the beholder: either straight from her fur, or by a longer route, from tiger to mirror to eye. The beholder sees two tigers moving in perfectly opposite synchrony.Look closer. Look past the smoothness of that coat to see its hairs; past its hairs to see the elaborate architectural arrangements of molecules that compose them, and then the atoms of which the molecules are made. Roughly a billionth of a meter wide, each atom is (to speak very loosely) its own solar system, with a dense center circled by distant electrons. At these levels&#x2014;molecular, atomic, electronic&#x2014;we are in the native land of quantum mechanics. The tigress, though large and vividly colored, must be near the mirror for a watcher to see two correlated cats. If she is in the jungle, a few yards&#x2019; separation would leave the mirror showing only undergrowth and swinging vines. Even out in the open, though, at a certain distance the curvature of the earth would rise up to obscure mirror from tigress and decouple their synchrony. But the entangled particles Bell was talking about in his paper can act in unison with the whole universe in between. Quantum entanglement, as Bell would go on to explain in his paper, is not really like Bertlmann&#x2019;s socks. No one puzzles over how he always manages to pick different-colored socks, or how he pulls the socks onto his feet. But in quantum mechanics there is no idiosyncratic brain &#x201c;choosing&#x201d; to coordinate distant particles, and it is hard not to compare how they do it to magic. In the &#x201c;real world,&#x201d; correlations are the result of local influences, unbroken chains of contact. One sheep butts another&#x2014;there&#x2019;s a local influence. A lamb comes running to his mother&#x2019;s bleat after waves of air molecules hit each other in an entirely local domino effect, starting from her vocal cords and ending when they beat the tiny drum in the baby&#x2019;s ear in a pattern his brain recognizes as <i>Mom</i>. Sheep scatter at the arrival of a coyote: the moving air has carried bits of coyote musk and dandruff into their nostrils, or the electromagnetic waves of light from the moon have bounced off the coyote&#x2019;s pelt and into the retinas of their eyes. Either way, it&#x2019;s all local, including the nerves firing in each sheep&#x2019;s brain to say danger, and carrying the message to her muscles. Grown up, sold, and separated on different farms, twin lambs both still chew their cud after eating, and produce lambs that look eerily similar. These correlations are still local. No matter how far the lambs ultimately separate, their genetic material was laid down when they were a single egg inside their mother&#x2019;s womb. Bell liked to talk about twins. He would show a photograph of the pair of Ohio identical twins (both named &#x201c;Jim&#x201d;) separated at birth and then reunited at age forty, just as Bell was writing &#x201c;Bertlmann&#x2019;s Socks.&#x201d; Their similarities were so striking that an institute for the study of twins was founded, appropriately enough at the University of Minnesota in the Twin Cities. Both Jims were nail-biters who smoked the same brand of cigarettes and drove the same model and color of car. Their dogs were named &#x201c;Toy,&#x201d; their ex-wives &#x201c;Linda,&#x201d; and current wives &#x201c;Betty.&#x201d; They were married on the same day. One Jim named his son James Alan, his twin named his son James Allen. They both liked carpentry&#x2014;one made miniature picnic tables and the other miniature rocking chairs.</p><h2>Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life with Alzheimer&#39;s</h2><p>"We are foolish, those of us who think we can escape the traps of aging," writes Tom DeBaggio. "I was one of them, dreaming of a perfect and healthy old age....Now, at fifty-eight, I realize the foolishness of my dreams as I watch my brain self-destruct from Alzheimer's." <i>Losing My Mind</i> is DeBaggio's extraordinary account of his early onset Alzheimer's, a disease that "silently hollows the brain" and slowly "gobbles memory and destroys life." But with DeBaggio's curse came an unexpected blessing: the ability to chart the mechanics and musings of his failing mind. <br> Whether describing the happy days of his youth or lamenting over the burden his disease has placed upon his loved ones, DeBaggio manages to inspire the reader with his ability to function, to think, and ultimately to survive. By turns an autobiography, a medical history, and a book of meditations, <i>Losing My Mind</i> is a testament to the splendor of memory and a triumphant celebration of the human spirit.</p><p>This first-person account of Alzheimer's ties several powerful stories together. <i>Losing My Mind</i> blends personal history with the fear and pain of developing the disease at the age of 57; it is both a sadly fascinating account of Alzheimer's progression and an attempt for the writer to remember his past before it is gone for good. <p> While his history is recounted in chronological order, these memories--of his childhood; marriage to his wife, Joyce; their years in writing and politics; his passion for herbs and the growing of a successful business--are interspersed with unrelated musings on everything from his cat's sudden deafness to losing his wallet. Clips from articles on Alzheimer's research are sprinkled around, and statistics like the $174,000 that a patient spends on the disease over a lifetime are sobering. Throughout the book, he clearly speaks of his diagnosis as a "sentence"; the lack of a cure is dwelt on in many sections, and a story about an accidental overdose of his prescriptions is particularly grim. </p><p> This is not a book that supplies any "power of positive thinking" messages, but instead shows the daily struggle of a man coming to terms with a terrible disease. Poignant and thoughtful, DeBaggio's life will hold meaning for anyone who has been touched by Alzheimer's. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><b>Thomas DeBaggio</b> has worked as both a professional herb grower and a newspaper journalist.

But though he&#x2019;d started out well, two months had now passed without so much as a line from him.<br> <br>She was torn between worry over what had stopped the flow of letters, and a desire to string her feckless brother up by his toes and let him see what it was like to be left hanging.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure you don&#x2019;t want to accompany me to Edinburgh on this case?&#x201d; Dom asked. &#x201c;You could take notes for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lisette looked over to see her half brother lounging in the doorway. At thirty-one he was leaner and harder than when they were young, and he now had a scar across his cheek that he wouldn&#x2019;t talk about, which came from God knew where. But he was still in her camp.<br> <br>Most of the time. She scowled. Sometimes he could be as bad as Tristan.<br> <br>Ever since Dom had fetched her here from France six months ago, she&#x2019;d worked hard to turn his rented town house into a home. Just because it also served as the office for Manton&#x2019;s Investigations didn&#x2019;t mean it had to feel cold and impersonal. But what had her efforts got her? Nothing but another man to govern her behavior.<br> <br>Sitting back in the chair, she lifted an eyebrow. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need me to take notes&#x2014;you remember everything word for word.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re better at descriptions than I am. You notice things about people that I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>She rolled her eyes. &#x201c;I will only go if you let me do more than describe things and make you tea.&#x201d;<br> <br>He eyed her warily. &#x201c;Like what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Interview witnesses. Follow suspects. Carry a pistol.&#x201d;<br> <br>To his credit, he didn&#x2019;t laugh. Tristan would have laughed. And then tried, again, to find her a suitable husband from among his swaggering soldier friends in Paris, who acted as if a half-English bastard like her should be grateful for every crumb of their attention.<br> <br>Instead, Dom eyed her consideringly as he came into the room. &#x201c;Do you even know how to use a pistol?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. Vidocq showed me.&#x201d; Only once, before Tristan put a stop to the lessons, but Dom needn&#x2019;t know that.<br> <br>He was already cursing Eug�ne Vidocq, the former head of the French secret police. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe our brother allowed you anywhere near that scoundrel.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shrugged. &#x201c;We needed the money. And Vidocq needed someone at the S�ret� Nationale whom he could trust to organize all his index cards containing descriptions of criminals. It was a good position.&#x201d;<br> <br>And to her surprise, she&#x2019;d enjoyed it. After Maman&#x2019;s death three years ago, when Lisette had moved to Paris to live with Tristan, she&#x2019;d craved useful work to take her mind off her grief. Vidocq had offered it to her. She&#x2019;d learned about investigating crimes from him. Vidocq had even proposed hiring her as an agent for the S�ret�, as he&#x2019;d done with other women, but Tristan had refused to allow it.<br> <br>She snorted. Tristan thought it perfectly fine for him to be an agent for the S�ret� all these years, but his sister was to be kept wrapped in cotton until she found a husband. Which got more unlikely by the year. She was already twenty-six, for pity&#x2019;s sake!<br> <br>&#x201c;What is your answer, Dom?&#x201d; she prodded her half brother. &#x201c;If I go with you, will you let me do more than take notes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not this time, but perhaps one day&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what Tristan always said.&#x201d; She sniffed. &#x201c;Meanwhile, he was plotting behind my back to get me married, and when that didn&#x2019;t work, he packed me off to London with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For which I&#x2019;m profoundly grateful,&#x201d; Dom said with a faint smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try to distract me with compliments. I&#x2019;m not going to marry any of your choices for husband, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he said cheerily. &#x201c;Because I don&#x2019;t have any. I&#x2019;m too selfish to want to lose you to a husband. I need you here.&#x201d;<br> <br>She eyed him uncertainly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just saying that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, dear girl, I&#x2019;m not. You&#x2019;ve got a wealth of information about Vidocq&#x2019;s methods stored up in that clever head. I&#x2019;d be mad to marry you off and lose all that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lisette softened. Dom had been much more accommodating about her learning his business than she&#x2019;d expected. Perhaps it was because he&#x2019;d struggled so hard to gain it, after George had cut him off entirely. Or perhaps it was because he remembered their childhood together fondly.<br> <br>Whatever the case, she would allow him some time. Perhaps eventually he would consider giving her broader duties. More exciting duties. She might finally get to travel, to satisfy the wanderlust she&#x2019;d inherited from Papa. It was a measure of how much Dom trusted her that he was leaving her here for a week with only the servants for company. This was the first time he&#x2019;d done so.<br> <br>&#x201c;So you think I&#x2019;m clever, do you?&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;And managing and opinionated and a pain in the arse&#x2014;&#x201d; At her frown, he softened his tone. &#x201c;But yes, also very clever. You have many good qualities, dear girl, and I do appreciate them. I&#x2019;m not Tristan, you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; She thumbed through the letters spread out on the desk. &#x201c;Speaking of our rapscallion brother, I haven&#x2019;t heard from him in months. It&#x2019;s not like him to be so silent. Generally he writes once a week.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dom strode up to the desk to collect some papers for his trip. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s probably on a case for Vidocq.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But Vidocq was forced to resign as head of the S�ret� last year.&#x201d;<br> <br>After Vidocq had left, Tristan had retained his position as an agent by the skin of his teeth. Because she hadn&#x2019;t been an agent, she&#x2019;d lost her position entirely. So her brother had decided it was time that she find a husband, even an English one. And since he dared not return to England because of the theft warrant against him, it had been left to Dom to take her to London.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then he&#x2019;s probably on a case for the new fellow,&#x201d; Dom said as he shoved documents into his satchel.<br> <br>&#x201c;I doubt that.&#x201d; She rose to wander toward the window. &#x201c;The new head of the S�ret� doesn&#x2019;t exactly like Tristan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because Tristan is damned good at what he does. That new fellow couldn&#x2019;t investigate a fruit seller for bruising an apple, so he resents anyone who shows him up.&#x201d; He shot her a side glance. &#x201c;Although, to be fair, our brother can try any employer&#x2019;s patience. He makes his own rules, keeps odd hours, and has a tendency not to tell anyone what he&#x2019;s up to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve just described yourself,&#x201d; she said dryly.<br> <br>A laugh sputtered out of him. &#x201c;All right, I&#x2019;ll concede that. But I work for myself, so I can act that way&#x2014;he has superiors who expect regular reports.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; she said absently as she gazed out the window, her attention caught by a man in a gray surtout across the street, who was staring at the town house most intently. He looked familiar. He looked like . . .<br> <br>She moved closer to the glass, and the man disappeared into the fog. A chill skittered down her spine that she forced herself to ignore. It couldn&#x2019;t be Hucker. He wouldn&#x2019;t be in London; he&#x2019;d be in Yorkshire with the rest of George&#x2019;s minions. If he even still worked for George.<br> <br>Dom walked toward her. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s also the fact that he has an annoying tendency to land himself in trouble without even trying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; she asked, startled into turning from the window.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tristan.&#x201d; He steadied a curious gaze on her. &#x201c;That is who we&#x2019;re discussing, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, of course.&#x201d; She forced herself to forget about Hucker. &#x201c;His penchant for getting into scrapes is precisely why I&#x2019;m worried. Even Vidocq used to say that Tristan purposely courts danger.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;True, but he always manages to extricate himself from it, too. He doesn&#x2019;t need you for that.&#x201d; Dom&#x2019;s gaze on her softened. &#x201c;I, on the other hand, need you for lots of things.&#x201d; Holding his gloved hand out to her, he pointed to a rip in the palm. &#x201c;You see? I did that just this morning. Can you fix it?&#x201d;<br> <br>He was trying to distract her from her worries, which was sweet of him, though completely transparent. Wordlessly, she drew off his glove, took out her mending box, and began sewing the rip closed.<br> <br>As she worked, her mind wandered to the man she&#x2019;d seen outside. Should she mention him to Dom? No, that would be foolish. He might decide to stay in London, which they could ill afford. His business was growing by the day, but he still couldn&#x2019;t pass up a case as lucrative as the one in Scotland.<br> <br>Besides, she wasn&#x2019;t even sure it was anything to be concerned about. It had been years since she&#x2019;d left the estate&#x2014;the man might not be Hucker at all. No point in alarming Dom for no reason.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d nearly finished repairing his glove when Dom&#x2019;s lone manservant&#x2014;butler, valet, and footman all in one&#x2014;entered the room. &#x201c;It is nearly nine, sir. You have only half an hour to make it to the docks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Skrimshaw,&#x201d; Dom drawled. &#x201c;I know how to read a clock.&#x201d;<br> <br>The florid-faced fellow stiffened. &#x201c;Begging your pardon, sir, but &#x2018;Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, So do our minutes hasten to their end.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>When Dom began to scowl, Lisette smothered a laugh and said hastily, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make sure he gets off in time, Shaw. He&#x2019;ll be along soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>Skrimshaw looked unconvinced but turned and left.<br> <br>&#x201c;I swear, if that man quotes any more Shakespeare to me, I&#x2019;ll turn him off,&#x201d; Dom complained.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you won&#x2019;t. You&#x2019;ll never find another who&#x2019;ll do what he does for so little salary.&#x201d; She tied off the thread and handed the glove to Dom. &#x201c;Besides, you provoked him by using his real name.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, for God&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; he said as he jerked his glove on, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to call my servant by a stage name, no matter how he spends most of his evenings.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You should be kinder to him, you know,&#x201d; she chided. &#x201c;Because of your insistence that he stay here to look after me at night while you&#x2019;re gone, he gave up his minor role that begins rehearsals this week. And in any case, he&#x2019;s right. It&#x2019;s time for you to leave.&#x201d; She fought a smile. &#x201c;All those minutes are hastening away.&#x201d;<br> <br>With a muttered oath, Dom turned for the door, then paused to glance back at her. &#x201c;About Tristan. If you haven&#x2019;t heard from him by the time I return from Scotland, I&#x2019;ll see what I can find out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Dom,&#x201d; she said softly, knowing what a concession that was.<br> <br>&#x201c;But don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll be running off to France after the rascal,&#x201d; he grumbled. &#x201c;Not unless someone pays me for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps while you&#x2019;re in Edinburgh I&#x2019;ll solve a case or two,&#x201d; she said lightly. &#x201c;Then I can pay you.&#x201d;<br> <br>He scowled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not remotely amusing. Promise me you won&#x2019;t try any such fool thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Casting him an enigmatic smile, she glanced at the clock. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll miss your ship if you don&#x2019;t leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So help me, Lisette, if you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go, go,&#x201d; she cried as she pushed him toward the door. &#x201c;You know perfectly well I&#x2019;m teasing you. Don&#x2019;t worry about me. I&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>At last he left, muttering about insolent servants and troublesome sisters. With a laugh, she returned to dealing with the mail, sorting each letter by the case it involved, then putting the inquiries for new cases into a pile to go through last.<br> <br>She spent the day responding to the correspondence, making notes on the cases she thought Dom might take, and dealing with household matters. It was nearly midnight before she got to bed. There was no point in retiring before then&#x2014;crowds of theatergoers thronged the streets most evenings. She enjoyed the noise and the bustle, which reminded her of the theaters where Maman had acted in Toulon.<br> <br>The streets were a bit quieter once she did go to bed and they generally stayed that way until midday, at least at their little end of Bow Street.<br> <br>So when a pounding on the door downstairs awakened her just past dawn, she nearly had heart failure. Who could be coming here so early? Oh dear, had something happened to delay Dom&#x2019;s ship to Edinburgh?<br> <br>Hastily donning her dressing gown over her night rail, she hurried into the hall just in time to hear Skrimshaw grumbling to himself as he headed for the door downstairs. He&#x2019;d scarcely gotten it open when a male voice snapped, &#x201c;I demand to see Mr. Manton.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon, sir,&#x201d; Skrimshaw said, donning his butler role with great aplomb. &#x201c;Mr. Manton does not see clients at this early hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a client. I&#x2019;m the Duke of Lyons,&#x201d; the man countered, his tone iced with the sort of anger only the aristocracy could manage. &#x201c;And he&#x2019;ll see me if he knows what&#x2019;s good for him.&#x201d;<br> <br>The bold statement sent Lisette rushing forward in a panic.<br> <br>&#x201c;Otherwise,&#x201d; the duke went on, &#x201c;I will be back with officers of the law to search every inch of this house for him and his&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not here,&#x201d; she said as she flew down the stairs, heedless of how she was dressed. The last thing Manton Investigations needed was an officious duke barging in with a crowd of officers merely because he was up in the boughs over some foolish matter. The gossip alone would ruin them.<br> <br>But as she reached the bottom of the stairs and caught sight of the man, she skidded to a halt. Because the fellow looming in the doorway beyond Skrimshaw did not look like a duke.<br> <br>Oh, he wore the clothing of a duke&#x2014;a top hat of expensive silk, a coat of exquisitely tailored cashmere, and a perfectly tied cravat. But every duke she&#x2019;d seen depicted in the papers or in satirical prints was gray-haired and stooped.<br> <br>This duke was neither. Tall and broad-shouldered, he was the most striking man she&#x2019;d ever seen. Not handsome, no. His features were too bold for that&#x2014;his jaw too sharply chiseled, his eyes too deeply set&#x2014;and his golden-brown hair was a touch too straight to be fashionable. But attractive, oh yes. It annoyed her that she noticed just how attractive.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dom&#x2019;s not here,&#x201d; she said again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then tell me where he is.&#x201d;<br> <br>The expectation that she would just march to his tune raised her hackles. She was used to dealing with his sort&#x2014;the worst thing she could do was let him bully her into revealing too much. After all, she still didn&#x2019;t know what this was about. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s on a case out of town, Your Grace. That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;m at liberty to say.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eyes the color of finest jade sliced down, ripping away whatever flimsy pretensions she might have. In one savage glance he unveiled her age, family connections, and station in life, making her feel all that she was . . . and was not.<br> <br>Those all-seeing eyes snapped back to her. &#x201c;And who are you? Manton&#x2019;s mistress?&#x201d;<br> <br>His words, spoken in a tone of studied contempt, had Skrimshaw turning positively scarlet, but before the servant could speak, she touched his arm. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll handle this, Shaw.&#x201d;<br> <br>Though the older man tensed, he knew her well enough to recognize the tone that presaged an epic set-down. Reluctantly, he stepped back.<br> <br>She met the duke&#x2019;s gaze coldly. &#x201c;How do you know I&#x2019;m not Manton&#x2019;s wife?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Manton doesn&#x2019;t have a wife.&#x201d;<br> <br>Supercilious oaf. Or, as Maman would have called him . . . English. He might not look like a duke, but he certainly acted like one. &#x201c;No, but he does have a sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>That seemed to give the duke pause. Then he caught himself and cast her a haughty stare. &#x201c;Non...</p><h2>Brown Is the New White: How the Demographic Revolution Has Created a New American Majority</h2><p><b><i><b><i>* NEW YORK TIMES</i> </b></i><b>BESTSELLER</b><i><b> </b>* WASHINGTON POST</i>&nbsp;BESTSELLER *&nbsp;</b>Despite the abundant evidence from Obama's victories proving that the U.S. population has fundamentally changed, many progressives and Democrats continue to waste millions of dollars chasing white swing voters. Explosive population growth of people of color in America over the past fifty years has laid the foundation for a New American Majority consisting of progressive people of color (23 percent of all eligible voters) and progressive whites (28 percent of all eligible voters). These two groups make up 51 percent of all eligible voters in America right now, and that majority is growing larger every day.

Controversies over the imbrications of knowledge and power and the complicity of Orientalism in the larger project of colonialism have been waged among generations of scholars. But has Orientalism come to stand in for all of the sins of European modernity, at the cost of neglecting the complicity of the rest of the academic disciplines?<br><br>In this landmark theoretical investigation, Wael B. Hallaq reevaluates and deepens the critique of Orientalism in order to deploy it for rethinking the foundations of the modern project. Refusing to isolate or scapegoat Orientalism, <i>Restating Orientalism</i> extends the critique to other fields, from law, philosophy, and scientific inquiry to core ideas of academic thought such as sovereignty and the self. Hallaq traces their involvement in colonialism, mass annihilation, and systematic destruction of the natural world, interrogating and historicizing the set of causes that permitted modernity to wed knowledge to power. <i>Restating Orientalism </i>offers a bold rethinking of the theory of the author, the concept of sovereignty, and the place of the secular Western self in the modern project, reopening the problem of power and knowledge to an ethical critique and ultimately theorizing an exit from modernity&#x2019;s predicaments. A remarkably ambitious attempt to overturn the foundations of a wide range of academic disciplines while also drawing on the best they have to offer, <i>Restating Orientalism </i>exposes the depth of academia&#x2019;s lethal complicity in modern forms of capitalism, colonialism, and hegemonic power.</p><p>Wael B. Hallaq is the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University, where he teaches and writes about Islamic law, ethics, and intellectual history. His books, translated into a number of languages, include <i>Shari&#x2bf;a: Theory, Practice, Transformations</i> (2009) and <i>The Impossible State: Islam, Politics, and Modernity&#x2019;s Moral Predicament</i> (2013), which won Columbia University Press&#x2019;s Distinguished Book Award.Going beyond the questions of representations of the Orient, Hallaq's work expands the scope of the critical discussion on Orientalism to reexamine the epistemological foundations of modern historical social sciences. (Sudipta Kaviraj, Columbia University)<br><br>It is becoming increasingly evident among decolonial thinkers that colonial management (with or without colonies, with or without settlers) is a question of controlling and managing knowledge, and that power differential is implicit in agents, institutions, and languages of epistemic governance. Wael B. Hallaq brilliantly drives us, through a meticulous reading of Edward Said&#x2019;s <i>Orientalism,</i> to the awareness that domination is grounded on epistemic sovereignty and that liberation is unthinkable without epistemic freedom. (Walter Mignolo, author of <i>On Decoloniality: Concepts, Analytics, Praxis</i>)<br><br>This book is a brilliant interrogation of Said's famous concept, highlighting the extent which the issue of Orientalism is not simply one of problematic European authors, but instead goes to the heart of how the modern project itself constitutes subjects, knowledge, and power. In this way, Hallaq argues that confronting Orientalism means confronting the forms of violences that have marked modernity and been justified and reproduced across the academic disciplines. This provocative work raises profound and challenging questions about academia and about the contemporary self. It is essential reading and will be debated by scholars for years to come. (Aziz Rana, author of <i>The Two Faces of American Freedom</i>)<br><br>If anyone is going to provide a nuanced and well thought-out critique, it would surely be Professor Hallaq. <i>Restating Orientalism</i> is a labour of love and Professor Hallaq is clearly very fond of Edward Said and his intellectual insights. (Usman Butt <i>TheNewArab</i>)</p><h2>The Risk Factor: Crossing the Chicken Line Into Your Supernatural Destiny</h2><p><p><i>The Risk Factor</i>: Crossing the Chicken Line Into Your Supernatural Destiny was written by a father-son team who discuss the dynamics and importance of risk as a Kingdom lifestyle of faith that rockets believers into the supernatural&#x2014;and into fulfilling their unique God-given destinies.

You could call it pure."<br>&#x2014;Jonathan Beckman, <i>Literary Review</i><br><br>"Every so often a historical novel comes along that is so natural, so far from pastiche, so modern, that it thrills and expands the mind.

It is packed with personal and physical details that evoke 18th-century Paris with startling immediacy.

It is fortunate, then, that Miller is a writer of subtlety and skill...Unlike many parables, however, <i>Pure </i>is neither laboured nor leaden. Miller writes like a poet, with a deceptive simplicity - his sentences and images are intense distillations, conjuring the fleeting details of existence with clarity. He is also a very humane writer, whose philosophy is tempered always with an understanding of the flaws and failings of ordinary people...<i>Pure</i> defies the ordinary conventions of storytelling, slipping dream-like between lucidity and a kind of abstracted elusiveness...

Why do so many of us cry at the movies? What's the difference between what happened in a movie and what happened in real life--and can we always tell the difference?

It advocates deep empiricism and provides the tools to get there--in a way that other ethnographic texts and methods courses do not. It is directly 'how to' rather than abstract and remote. Perhaps the most remarkable quality stems from Nippert-Eng's extensive observational studies of non-human species, particularly gorillas at the Lincoln Park Zoo. Watching such animals is her 'laboratory' to become acutely aware of behavior in others and she presses students to come up with analogous ways to sharpen their fieldwork skills....

Most management books are all theory &#x2013; it's rare to read a real manager, of a real team, actually trying to make it all work. More so than any theory, reading well written accounts of how real managers manage does more than piles of theory books in helping managers see what's possible and how it's supposed to work. </p> <p>Think of the best teacher you ever had. Now think of the worst. Both gave homework, both gave grades, yet the feeling you had about those same activities things was different with each of them. That's the way a good manager needs to think. Trust is huge: you trust a good manager to have good reasons for pushing you, just as you would for a great teacher. And much like teachers, there is no quick tip that separates good managers from bad: it takes time, experience and patience to learn.</p> <p><b>You say in this book "the bottleneck is never code or creativity; its clarity" Is this the biggest issue in the way for companies trying to move forward? </b></p> <p>Any moderate sized corporation is a wasteland of indecisiveness: it's all committees, review meetings and endless email chains. We all know too many people have veto powers. If you simply clarified who was the equivalent of a film director for a product, or a division, who was empowered to break ties, everyone would be freed to do better work: they'd spend more time actually working and less time fighting over turf. <em>The Year Without Pants</em> explores this in many ways, as the autonomy of the culture created bottlenecks of a kind all on their own. </p> <p><b>What was the hardest aspect of working at Wordpress.com for you personally?</b></p> <p>I'm exposed in many ways in <em>The Year Without Pants</em>.

Mediocre processes amplify politics by creating more turf and more restrictions. Any process should include a clause that defines when the process is no longer necessary. This never happens and the result is rules live on forever even after if their usefulness died years ago. Process should be a slave to results, but it rarely is. It's often the other way around. </p> <p><b>This is a really interesting observation: "Every manager is kind of a new experiment, and any experiment that goes wrong should change." Do companies promoting someone to manager need to change what and how they evaluate success?</b></p> <p>70% of all American employees are unengaged at work (Gallup 2013). All of those workers work for managers who are failing them. Management, as a discipline, is a failure: we are not, on average, good at it as a nation. We should be experimenting with the very notion of management itself: why not elect managers? Or promote them only on a trial basis? Or give the people who work for them the power to reverse a promotion? As wild as these ideas might sound I bet any of them would provide better results than that 70% number. The bar for management is that low.</p> <p>As Americans it's absurd how we never consider democratic principles for management. Instead we have a system modeled on what: monarchy? Oligarchy? I'm no radical, but I am open to other influences in structuring how the powerful are chosen at corporations. </p> <p><b>It seems that storytelling, relationships, humor &#x2013; i.e. the humanity of WordPress.com &#x2013; is so consciously intended &#x2013; and with great results. But didn&#x2019;t they launch it with this in mind? How would a 200 year old company, say, with layers of tradition even begin to try to change its culture to get at a more meaningful workplace? </b></p> <p>My story at Automattic is all about culture change: It was a suicide mission for me to introduce traditional management ideas into a company born of open source, independence and autonomy. I was an outsider with a radically different set of beliefs and experiences, which makes the core story of the book one about culture change: or at least my insane attempts to make culture change happen. </p> <p>Any 200 year old company didn't start that way. It was grown and you change a company the same way: you plant seeds and nurture them. One bright manager plants a small seed in their own team with some different rules. When they show better results than other teams, other managers follow. Soon there is a high performing minority and if the CEO has a clue they'll invest in how to make that minority the majority. One way to read the <em>The Year Without Pants</em> is "the year of attempting culture change." How can an expert on management be useful in a place that doesn't believe in management at all?

The purpose of the CFI -- and this unique handbook -- is to make it easier for providers to account for the influence of culture in their clinical work to enhance patient-clinician communication and improve outcomes. Cultural psychiatry as a field has evolved enormously from the days when it was principally concerned with epidemiological and clinical studies of disease prevalence; it now examines a multitude of issues, primary among them the differing patient, family, and practitioner models of illness and treatment experiences within and across cultures. The editors, all of whom have been intimately involved in the evolution of the field, have designed the book and accompanying videos for maximum instructional and clinical utility. The Handbook boasts many strengths and useful features, including: * A detailed description of each of the three CFI components: a core 16-item questionnaire, which can be applied in any clinical setting with any patient by any mental health clinician; an informant version of the core CFI used to obtain information from caregivers; and 12 supplementary modules that expand on these basic assessments. This material facilitates implementation of the CFI by clinicians.* Over a dozen clinical vignettes are included to illustrate use of the three components, and the Handbook also includes multiple videos that demonstrate the application of portions of the core CFI, and several supplementary modules.* Strategies for incorporating the CFI into clinical training are identified and discussed, furthering the objective of developing culturally-sensitive and astute practitioners.* The theoretical bases of the CFI are explored, raising questions for discussion and identifying areas for further research. The CFI is a valuable tool for all patients, not just those judged to be culturally different. The CFI has been called the single most practically useful contribution of cultural psychiatry and medical anthropology to clinical psychiatry, primary care, and medicine in general. DSM-5(R) Handbook on the Cultural Formulation Interview is the only book on the market that equips readers with the skills and insight to incorporate the CFI into practice, making it a critically important addition to the clinical literature.</p><p><p>The Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) is a product of the arduous process that resulted in publication of the DSM-5, and only one book -- DSM-5 Handbook of the Cultural Formulation Interview -- provides clinicians with the background and guidance they need to implement the CFI. The Handbook teaches the reader how to conduct a cultural assessment using the CFI, which consists of three types of semistructured interviews. Although the CFI was not designed to be the sole basis for making a clinical diagnosis, it can be used in research and clinical settings to enhance clinical understanding and decision making. The volume presents techniques to help providers situate their work within the context of a patient's culture to enhance communication -- not only with those of different cultures but across all clinical encounters. Especially instructive are the supplemental videos that demonstrate application of the CFI components through the use of clinical vignettes.</p><p>Clinicians will, of course, find the DSM-5� Handbook of the Cultural Formulation Interview indispensable, but administrators, policy makers, advocates, and other practitioners who work collaboratively to engage patients in the mental health care process will also value its clarity and comprehensiveness.</p>Roberto Lewis-Fernandez, M.D., M.T.S., is a Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center and is the Director of the New York State Center of Excellence for Cultural Competence and of the Hispanic Treatment Program at the New York State Psychiatry Institute, New York, New York.

Taking insights from complexity theory as his point of departure, the author observes that we live in a world where things are interconnected, where unintended consequences of our actions are unavoidable and unpredictable, and where the total effect of behavior is not equal to the sum of individual actions. Jervis draws on a wide range of human endeavors to illustrate the nature of these system effects. He shows how increasing airport security might actually cost lives, not save them, and how removing dead trees (ostensibly to give living trees more room) may damage the health of an entire forest. Similarly, he highlights the interconnectedness of the political world as he describes how the Cold War played out and as he narrates the series of events--with their unintended consequences--that escalated into World War I.</p><br><p> The ramifications of developing a rigorous understanding of politics are immense, as Jervis demonstrates in his critique of current systemic theories of international politics--especially the influential work done by Kenneth Waltz. Jervis goes on to examine various types of negative and positive feedback, bargaining in different types of relationships, and the polarizing effects of alignments to begin building a foundation for a more realistic, more nuanced, theory of international politics. <i>System Effects</i> concludes by examining what it means to act in a system. It shows how political actors might modify their behavior in anticipation of system effects, and it explores how systemic theories of political behavior might account for the role of anticipation and strategy in political action. This work introduces powerful new concepts that will reward not only international relations theorists, but also all social scientists with interests in comparative politics and political theory.</p></p><p><p>"<i>System Effects</i> presents a new way of looking at the international system as a network of inter-connections.

Simply stated, Navigating the Doctoral Journey: A Handbook of Strategies for Success is a must read for anyone in higher education. (<i>Higher Education</i>)<br><br>Doctoral education can be the most life-changing process in the lives of many. However, all too often, there are few roadmaps to guide sojourners on this critically important journey. Rockinson-Szapkiw and Spaulding provide a truly helpful, informative, and insightful book for navigating all phases of obtaining a doctoral degree. This type of book is long overdue, and begins to fill a very important educational gap....Rockinson-Szapkiw and Spaulding nicely promote awareness of a wide array of coping activities that can greatly enhance one's life in any doctoral program....The chapters are relatively short and practical, and thus perfect for doctoral students who invariably have very busy schedules....In sum, Rockinson-Szapkiw and Spaulding bring a great deal of vision and heart to this landmark book, and provide a much needed beacon of light and clarity for those contemplating or navigating the exciting road ahead in their doctoral journey. (Puncky Heppner, University of Missouri)<br><br>Navigating the Doctoral Journey: A Handbook of Strategies for Success is extremely timely. Amanda J. Rockinson-Szapkiw and Lucinda S. Spaulding have provided a reader-friendly book that takes a holistic approach, designed to guide students from the entry stage to the completion stage of the doctoral process. An extremely useful aspect of this book is the identification of the major risks and challenges faced by doctoral students at the various stages of their journeys. Even more importantly, this book contains an array of practical strategies for addressing the risks and challenges that stem from current, evidence-based research. Rockinson-Szapkiw and Spaulding&#x2019;s book is not only useful for doctoral students at all stages of their degree programs; it also is useful for master&#x2019;s students who are embarking or thinking about embarking on a doctoral journey. Many others, too, can benefit from reading this book, including doctoral students&#x2019; significant others (e.g., spouses, partners), doctoral advisors/supervisors, mentors, and instructors. Simply put, this seminal book begins to fill a void such that it will make a significant contribution to the literature. (Anthony J.

After marrying in 1970, they moved to California, where Terry earned her doctorate in marine ecology at the University of Southern California and Gerry earned his doctorate in neurobiology at the California Institute of Technology. As postdoctoral students at the University of Washington&#x2019;s marine laboratories, they worked together on the neural bases of behavior, using a marine mollusk as a model system.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>They are now emeritus professors of biology at the University of Colorado Denver, where they taught introductory biology and neurobiology from 1982 through 2006. In their research, funded primarily by the National Institutes of Health, they investigated the mechanisms by which neurons are harmed by low levels of environmental pollutants and protected by estrogen.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Terry and Gerry are long-time members of many conservation organizations and share a deep appreciation of nature and of the outdoors. They enjoy hiking in the Rockies, walking and horseback riding near their home outside Steamboat Springs, and singing in the community chorus.

A comprehensive guide supported by photos that demonstrate palpation techniques of surface body landmarks, <i>Clinical Guide to Musculoskeletal Palpation</i> assists students and health care professionals in becoming proficient in surface palpation techniques, which are a prerequisite for working in the manual therapy professions. </p><p> As working professionals and instructors with years of experience using musculoskeletal palpation, Drs. Masaracchio and Frommer are in a unique position to provide a guide that is both clinically oriented and user friendly. For optimal readability and most direct delivery of its content, the text divides the human body into regions instead of joints. Bony and soft tissue structures are covered conjointly instead of independently, allowing for better comprehension of anatomical relationships and ultimately leading to improved clinical examination skills. </p><p> Employing a step-by-step approach, <i>Clinical Guide to Musculoskeletal Palpation</i> describes each stage in using palpation as a key component during a physical examination, covering the bony tissue, soft tissue, and neurovascular structures of all body regions. Following are some key features of this text: </p><p> � Regional body sections and bulleted text allow for easy reading and enhanced comprehension. </p><p> � Techniques are illustrated in a manner unique to clinical practice, which facilitates student learning. </p><p> � Each chapter contains pearls of information that promote an appreciation for and acquisition of the inherent feel that is essential for effective palpation. </p><p> � Each chapter concludes with a case study presenting a common regional clinical condition, providing readers the opportunity to integrate and apply their new understanding and proficiency. </p><p> � The size and format allow the text to be durable and user friendly for clinic and lab activities. </p><p> All palpation techniques are presented with easy-to-follow instructions that enable a complete command of the procedure. Anatomical artwork of bony anatomy and soft tissue structures allows for visualization and thus better comprehension of anatomical relationships. This approach fosters a strong foundation that enhances clarity and application of anatomical knowledge to optimize the development of palpation skills. The most comprehensive resource of its kind, <i>Clinical Guide to Musculoskeletal Palpation</i> is a must-have for all practitioners, instructors, and students in the manual therapy professions. </p></p><p><p><b>Michael Masaracchio, PT, PhD, OCS, SCS, FAAOMPT</b>, is an associate professor and coordinator of the anatomy lab in the department of physical therapy at Long Island University in Brooklyn.

In traditional historical and scholarly accounts of the making and fighting of wars, women are often nowhere to be seen. With few exceptions, war stories are told as if men were the only ones who plan, fight, are injured by, and negotiate ends to wars. As the pages of this book tell, though, those accounts are far from complete. Women can be found at every turn in the (gendered) phenomena of war. Women have participated in the making, fighting, and concluding of wars throughout history, and their participation is only increasing at the turn of the 21st century. Women experience war in multiple ways: as soldiers, as fighters, as civilians, as caregivers, as sex workers, as sexual slaves, refugees and internally displaced persons, as anti-war activists, as community peace-builders, and more. This book at once provides a glimpse into where women are in war, and gives readers the tools to understood women&#x2019;s (told and untold) war experiences in the greater context of the gendered nature of global social and political life.</p><p><p><b>Carol Cohn</b> is the author of <i>Women and Wars: Contested Histories, Uncertain Futures</i>, published by Wiley.</p><b>Book of the month on <i>Intercross</i></b><br> <br> "<i>Women and Wars</i> fills the vacuum left by the 'women as victims' approach that characterized the early 2000's, with a diverse array of options for understanding the roles and perspectives that women have during conflict, including: soldiers, civilians, caregivers, sex workers, refugees and internally displaced persons, anti-war activists, and community peace-builders"<br><b><i>PRISM</i></b><br> <br> "If I were to deliver a course or module focused on the topic of 'women and wars', this is without a doubt the textbook I would choose."<br> <i><b>Gender and Development</b></i><br> <br> "To my mind, the very best academic work makes its reader sit up and take notice, either because the ideas are unfamiliar or because familiar ideas have been articulated in a new and engaging way.

The three authors--Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay--were respectively the first Secretary of the Treasury, the fourth President, and the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in American history. Each had played a crucial role in the events of the American Revolution, and their essays make a compelling case for a new and united nation, governed under a written Constitution that endures to this day. <em>The Federalist Papers</em> are an indispensable guide to the intentions of the founding fathers and a canonical text in the development of western political thought. This is the first edition to explain the many classical, mythological, and historical references in the text, and to pay full attention to the erudition of the three authors, which enabled them to place the infant American republic in a long tradition of self-governing states.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>"This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren ... should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties." So wrote John Jay, one of the revolutionary authors of <i>The Federalist Papers,</i> arguing that if the United States was truly to be a single nation, its leaders would have to agree on universally binding rules of governance--in short, a constitution. In a brilliant set of essays, Jay and his colleagues Alexander Hamilton and James Madison explored in minute detail the implications of establishing a kind of rule that would engage as many citizens as possible and that would include a system of checks and balances. Their arguments proved successful in the end, and <i>The Federalist Papers</i> stand as key documents in the founding of the United States.<br><strong>Lawrence Goldman</strong> is Fellow and Tutor in Modern History, St Peter's College, Oxford.

This reality becomes clear from the voices of Asian Americans heard in this first in-depth book on the experiences of racism among Asian Americans from many different nations and social classes. Chou and Feagin assess racial stereotyping and discrimination from dozens of interviews across the country with Asian Americans in a variety of settings, from elementary schools to colleges, workplaces, and other public arenas. They explore the widely varied ways of daily coping that Asian Americans employ-some choosing to conform and others actively resisting. This book dispels notions that Asian Americans are universally &#34;favored&#34; by whites and have an easy time adapting to life in American society. The authors conclude with policy measures that can improve the lives not only of Asian Americans but also of other Americans of color.</p><p><b>Rosalind S.

Some respondents resign themselves to situations while others challenge and actively resist stereotyping, inequitable treatment, and harassment.

Here, Donald E. Heller and other higher education scholars and practitioners explore the current debates surrounding these key issues. </p><p>As students and their families struggle to meet rising tuition prices, and as state funding for higher education dwindles, policymakers confront issues of affordability within state and institutional budgets. Changing demographics and challenges to affirmative action complicate the admissions process even as colleges and universities seek to diversify enrollments. And issues of institutional accountability have forced the restructuring of higher education governing boards and a reexamination of the role of public trustees in governance.</p><p>This collection analyzes how issues of affordability, access, and accountability influence the way in which state governments approach, monitor, and set public higher education policy.

Brown here identifies areas in which musical notation conveyed rather different messages to the musicians for whom it was written than it does to modern performers, and seeks to look beyond the notation to understand how composers might have expected to hear their music realized in performance. There is ample evidence to demonstrate that, in many respects, the sound worlds in which Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, and Brahms created their music were more radically different from ours than is generally assumed.<br></p><p><br><strong>Clive Brown</strong> is Professor of Applied Musicology, University of Leeds; and Consultant, London Classical Players<br><br>"This book will revolutionize the study of music...The book weaves strong patterns from the conflicting habits of different places, people and periods.

Often overlooked in accounts of how we think about ourselves and others, Richard Kearney skilfully shows, with the help of vivid examples and illustrations, how the human outlook on the world is formed by the mysterious triumvirate of strangers, gods and monsters.<br>Throughout, Richard Kearney shows how<em> Strangers, Gods and Monsters</em> do not merely reside in myths or fantasies but constitute a central part of our cultural unconscious. Above all, he argues that until we understand better that the Other resides deep within ourselves, we can have little hope of understanding how our most basic fears and desires manifest themselves in the external world and how we can learn to live with them.</p><p><strong>Richard Kearney</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Boston College and University College Dublin. His publications include <em>On Stories</em>,<em>Wake of Imagination</em> and <em>Postnationalist Ireland</em> (all published by Routledge), and <em>Sam's Fall</em> (novel)."In this brilliant book Richard Kearney sets his sights on the hyperbolic inflation of otherness. The refusal to acknowledge 'oneself-as-another, ' as Ricoeur puts it, generates visions of otherness that call for a critical hermeneutics. Like Baudrillard, Benjamin, and Zizek before him, Kearney has a finely tuned ear for the often hysterical workings of the media and popular culture, and in this respect his chapter reflecting on 9/11 is exemplary. He argues convincingly for the need for judgment when we 'welcome strangers, respect gods, and acknowledge monsters'. In this endeavor, Kearney is the ideal companion, and he proves again to be one of the liveliest philosophical minds in America."<br>-David Wood, Vanderbilt University <br>""Strangers, Gods, and Monsters along with the other two volumes in the trilogy, stands as an important contribution to the fields of religious theory and Continental philosophy.

But what does this "success" look like to the welfare mothers and welfare caseworkers who experienced it? In <em>Flat Broke With Children</em>, Sharon Hays tells us the story of welfare reform from inside the welfare office and inside the lives of welfare mothers, describing the challenges that welfare recipients face in managing their work, their families, and the rules and regulations of welfare reform.<br> Welfare reform, experienced on the ground, is not a rosy picture. The majority of adult welfare clients are <em>mothers</em>--over 90 percent--and the time limits imposed by welfare reform throw millions of these mostly unmarried, desperate women into the labor market, where they must accept low wages, the most menial work, the poorest hours, with no benefits, and little flexibility. Hays provides a vivid portrait of their lives--debunking many of the stereotypes we have of welfare recipients--but she also steps back to explore what welfare reform reveals about the meaning of work and family life in our society. In particular, she argues that an inherent contradiction lies at the heart of welfare policy, which emphasizes traditional family values even as its ethic of "personal responsibility" requires women to work and leave their children in childcare or at home alone all day long. <br> Hays devoted three years to visiting welfare clients and two welfare offices, one in a medium-sized town in the Southeast, another in a large, metropolitan area in the West. Drawing on this hands-on research, <em>Flat Broke With Children</em> is the first book to explore the impact of welfare reform on motherhood, marriage, and work in women's lives, and the first book to offer us a portrait of how welfare reform plays out in thousands of local welfare offices and in millions of homes across the nation.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sharon Hays</strong> is Barbra Streisand Professor in Contemporary Gender Studies and Professor of Sociology at the University of Southern California. The author of <em>The Cultural Contradictions of Motherhood</em>, she has been interviewed for publications such as <em>The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Parenting,</em> <em>Working Mother Magazine</em>, and <em>U.S. News and World Report.</em><br>"With President Bush pushing for more hours in the required workweek, the timing couldn't be better for 'Flat Broke With Children'; Hays's detailed, judicious survey of the reforms punctures mythology on all sides of the debate.... Indeed, the strength of 'Flat Broke' is its blending of an<br>academic's statistics and analysis with the techniques and eye for detail of a journalist."--Boston Globe<br><br>"A balanced portrait of the most controversial of all public programs. Thoughful and well researched."--Kirkus Reviews<br><br>"Hays' subjects tell stories of the extreme poverty, broken families, sexual abuse, homelessness, and the lengths to which they go in attempts to juggle multiple part-time low-paying jobs, but they do not portray themselves as victims."--Publishers Weekly<br><br>"This very readable, important, and stimulating work deals with the consequences of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996."--Library Journal<br><br>"Flat Broke with Children is simply the best original work on welfare reform to date. Based on interviews with dozens of welfare recipients in two cities, it explains how 'reformed' welfare really works on the ground--and what it does to the lives of poor families. Painful as it often is to<br>read, Flat Broke belongs at the top of the to-do list for anyone involved in the welfare debate, on any side."--Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Nickel and Dimed: On Not Getting By In America<br><br>"A compelling study of the American system of welfare reform. Sharon Hays' engaging book is replete with insights on the impact of welfare reform on the procedures of welfare offices and on the lives of mothers and children who receive public assistance.

Yet, until now, no historical account has explained how we came to care about killer whales in the first place. <br><br>Drawing on interviews, official records, private archives, and his own family history, Jason M. Colby tells the exhilarating and often heartbreaking story of how people came to love the ocean's greatest predator. Historically reviled as dangerous pests, killer whales were dying by the hundreds, even thousands, by the 1950s--the victims of whalers, fishermen, and even the US military. In the Pacific Northwest, fishermen shot them, scientists harpooned them, and the Canadian government mounted a machine gun to eliminate them. But that all changed in 1965, when Seattle entrepreneur Ted Griffin became the first person to swim and perform with a captive killer whale. The show proved wildly popular, and he began capturing and selling others, including Sea World's first Shamu.<br><br>Over the following decade, live display transformed views of <em>Orcinus orca</em>. The public embraced killer whales as charismatic and friendly, while scientists enjoyed their first access to live orcas. In the Pacific Northwest, these captive encounters reshaped regional values and helped drive environmental activism, including Greenpeace's anti-whaling campaigns. Yet even as Northwesterners taught the world to love whales, they came to oppose their captivity and to fight for the freedom of a marine predator that had become a regional icon. <br><br>This is the definitive history of how the feared and despised "killer" became the beloved "orca"--and what that has meant for our relationship with the ocean and its creatures.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jason M. Colby</strong> is associate professor of environmental and international history at the University of Victoria. Born in Victoria, British Columbia, and raised in the Seattle area, he worked as a commercial fisherman in Alaska and Washington State. He is the author of <em>The Business of Empire: United</em> <em>Fruit, Race, and US Expansion in Central America</em>.<br><br>"Detailed, determinedly even-handed and often fascinating."-- Lucy Atkins, <em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"Colby is an easy and engaging writer... He utilizes extensive interviews he conducted with many of the most colorful and important people involved in the story: those who captured whales, the promoters, fishermen, scientists, and the citizens and politicians who became involved in the fight to halt the capture." -- Carmel Finley, <em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"This is an affecting book, personal and political all at once, and written by a scholar who has worked hard to recover and relay painful tales of the wild orcas that encountered humans and the humans that did the encountering. Nearly all those meetings began in panic and pain, most of it the whales', though some of it that of the men who came to believe they were doing the wrong thing wresting these breathtaking animals from their world, to deliver them to our own--which has been changed by the resulting episodes of captivity and captivation." -- D. Graham Burnett, author of <em>The</em> <em>Sounding of the Whale</em><p></p><br>"This fascinating history reveals what happens when humans became captivated by captive orcas. Colby poignantly locates the very origins of conservation in the tense, tender, and tragic relationships between humans and cetaceans. This finely textured social history of the Pacific Northwest opens up the story of how 'killer whales'--once cast as deadly pests--became popular attractions and emotional, intelligent 'orcas'." -- Daniel Bender, author of <em>The Animal Game: Searching for Wildness at the American Zoo</em><p></p><br>"With <em>Orca</em>, Jason Colby takes readers on a riveting journey. In a matter of decades, the Pacific Northwest's killer whales traveled from despised vermin to regional sweethearts. Their emotional passage revealed the true wildcard of wildlife management: navigating the swirling opinions of human populations. A timely book, <em>Orca</em> brings history to bear on a fraught relationship between two apex predators. Colby traces the rise in human affection for the whales but also the emergence of a cruel realization as audiences cheered captives' performances in aquariums across the globe. Love and fandom could kill and maim as efficiently as fear and contempt. In the end, it's unclear whether orcas benefited from the connection they forged with people." -- Jon Coleman, author of <em>Vicious: Wolves and Men in America</em><p></p><br>"Killer whales, or orcas--the apex marine predators--were once widely feared as dangerous vermin and were shot on sight. Yet over the past fifty years, a sea change in attitudes towards this remarkable animal took place, and today the species is a revered and cherished global icon of the wild marine environment. In this compelling book, Jason Colby chronicles this transition in our relationship with the killer whale and tells an enthralling story complete with drama and excitement. It is sure to be an important addition to the libraries of natural historians and whale enthusiasts alike." -- John Ford, Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada<p></p><br>"Colby shines a light on how little we understand of these magnificent creatures. His book gives a glimpse into a mysterious yet strangely familiar world, brought to life in a story that's tragic, heartbreaking, and finally hopeful."--<em>Foreword Reviews</em>, Starred Review <br><p></p><br>"A good choice for serious fans of Pacific Northwest and marine history."--<em>Kirkus</em><p></p><br>"A revealing look at how the human view of orcas has changed... Colby persuasively contends that, despite legitimate concerns popularized by the 2013 documentary <em>Blackfish</em>, about the effects of captivity on orcas, the animals avoided extinction because their presence in accessible public venues enabled people to relate to them... Colby has produced an originally argued and accessibly jargon-free consideration of a hot-button animal conservation issue."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> <br><p></p><br>"Killer whales, also known as orcas, are idolized, loved, and even revered. Such sentiments, however, have not always been held toward this species, as historian Jason Colby reveals in his new book, <em>Orca</em>... Colby does an excellent job of framing these events within the larger environmental movement of the time, as well as placing them within the context of the nationalism that was spreading on both sides of the U.S.-Canadian border at the time." <br>--Robin W. Baird, <em>Science</em><p></p><br>"[Told] with the depth and passion the topic deserves."--<em>Seattle Times</em> <br><p></p><br>"Immersive and dramatic... Colby demonstrates the speed at which societal attitudes can also shift the baseline of our expectations. In this age of extinction, with ongoing changes in ocean chemistry and physics, it is the potential for a sea change in public attitude that presents hope."--<em>Nature</em><p></p><br>"An exceptional book and a significant contribution to the conservation of killer whales, <em>Orca</em> brings together a wealth of information and tells the stories of the captive whales and the people who pursued, cared for, and studied them - and ultimately fought for their freedom... It instantly takes its place as one of the best books ever written about the interactions between killer whales and settler society on the coastlines of B.C. and Washington State. It should be read by every whale enthusiast, naturalist, fishing guide, graduate student, researcher, marine resource manager, and politician on the Pacific coast."--<em>Ormsby Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"It is a story not just of the orca business, but also of the evolution of Americans' relationship to the oceans and marine life-the growth of marine parks parallels the shift from an extractive approach to the ocean, as mainly a source of fish, to a recreational one. It intersects, too, with the birth of the modern environmental movement in the 1960s and 70s."--<em>New Republic</em> <br><p></p><br>"[Colby] has produced an exhaustive, nuanced, essential account of the captures, unearthing a forgotten bit of Northwest history."--<em>Literary Review of Canada</em> <br><p></p><br>"A riveting behind-the-scenes 'tell all,' told from the perspectives of the individuals that witnessed this important period in our history. This book is a historical account of how an industry formed, nearly destroying the very commodity on which it depended, coupled with an infusion of science that helped us to better understand killer whale life history. Colby retells a tragic yet sobering story of the good and dark sides of the delicate relationship between humans and other sentient beings."--Eric L. Walters, <em>Journal of Mammalogy</em> <br><p></p><br>"Masterful... In this passionate and meticulous study, Colby convincingly argues that the turbulent business of capture and public display initially cultivated public fascination with orcas and eventually assured their legal protection... Through this poignant meditation on the personal, ecological, and political consequences of killer whale capture, Colby makes a significant contribution to the history of human-animal relationships." <br>--<em>Pacific Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"A timely, readable account."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Psychology of Happiness</h2><p><p>What is happiness?&nbsp; Why are some people happier than others?</p> <p></p> <p>This new edition of <em>The Psychology of Happiness</em> provides a comprehensive and up-to-date account of research into the nature of happiness.

In Euripides' <em>Hippolytos</em>, however--informed by the playwright's moral and religious fascination--we find a Phaidra resisting the goddess of love with all her strength, though in the end unsuccessfully. Phaidra becomes a tragic foil for Hippolytos, making his superhuman virtue at once believable and understandable.<br>Robert Bagg's profound translation of this Euripidean masterpiece is idiomatic, natural, and intensely lyrical, designed not only to be read but performed. Unlike most versions, Bagg's <em>Hippolytos</em> sustains the dramatic tome and dynamics to the very end--even after Phaidra's death--and the moving scenes between Hippolytos and Theseus, and later Hippolytos' death-scene with Artemis, receive here unprecedented plausibility and power.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert Bagg</strong> is a recipient of the Prix de Rome for poetry and is author of critical studies of Sappho and Catallus.<br>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (Texts in Computer Science)</h2><p><p><em>Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications</em> explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images.

A series of letters to an unknown correspondent reveals the coming of age trials of a high-schooler named Charlie.</p><p>What is most notable about this funny, touching, memorable first novel from Stephen Chbosky is the resounding accuracy with which the author captures the voice of a boy teetering on the brink of adulthood. Charlie is a freshman. And while's he's not the biggest geek in the school, he is by no means popular. He's a wallflower--shy and introspective, and intelligent beyond his years, if not very savvy in the social arts. We learn about Charlie through the letters he writes to someone of undisclosed name, age, and gender, a stylistic technique that adds to the heart-wrenching earnestness saturating this teen's story. Charlie encounters the same struggles that many kids face in high school--how to make friends, the intensity of a crush, family tensions, a first relationship, exploring sexuality, experimenting with drugs--but he must also deal with his best friend's recent suicide. Charlie's letters take on the intimate feel of a journal as he shares his day-to-day thoughts and feelings: <p> </p><blockquote> I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. If they like their jobs. Or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why. </blockquote> With the help of a teacher who recognizes his wisdom and intuition, and his two friends, seniors Samantha and Patrick, Charlie mostly manages to avoid the depression he feels creeping up like kudzu. When it all becomes too much, after a shocking realization about his beloved late Aunt Helen, Charlie retreats from reality for awhile. But he makes it back in due time, ready to face his sophomore year and all that it may bring. Charlie, sincerely searching for that feeling of "being infinite," is a kindred spirit to the generation that's been slapped with the label X. <i>--Brangien Davis</i>Stephen Chbosky wrote and directed the feature film adaptation of his award-winning novel, <i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</i>.

While her twin sister Marty thinks settling down with one man is just a waste of good cowboys, Cathy wants it all: the perfect husband, the baby, and a little house right there in Cadillac. But even as the town is laying bets on whose wedding will be next, Cathy doesn't see happily-ever-after happening anytime soon. </p><p>Fortunately, Cathy and Marty have best friends who aren't afraid to stir up a ruckus-and if it means Cathy's got to bust out and set the town on its ear they'll back her up-no matter how hot things get.</p><p>(Originally published as <em>The Blue-Ribbon Jalapeno Society Jubilee</em>.)</p><p>"Carolyn Brown's storytelling is humorous, heartwarming, and full of sass and spunk...the chemistry sizzles." -<em>RT Book Reviews</em><br>"Ms. Brown has written some of the best dialogue I've read in a while...completely believable." -<em>Fresh Fiction</em><br>"I know when I read a book by Carolyn Brown, I'm in for a treat." -<em>Long and Short Reviews</em></p></p><p>Carolyn Brown is a New York Times and USA Today bestselling author with more than sixty books published.

It was all Prissy's damn fault that Marty was in such a hurry to get to the Blue-Ribbon Jalape�o Society monthly meeting that night, so Prissy should have to shell out the almost two hundred dollars for that ticket. </p> <p>They were already passing around the crystal bowl to take up the voting ballots when Marty slung open the door to Violet Prescott's sunroom and yelled, "Don't count 'em without my vote."</p> <p>Twenty faces turned to look at her and not a one of them, not even her twin sister, Cathy, was smiling. Hell's bells, who had done pissed on their cucumber sandwiches before she got there, anyway? A person didn't drop dead from lack of punctuality, did they?</p> <p>One wall of the sunroom was glass and looked out over lush green lawns and flower gardens. The other three were covered with shadow boxes housing the blue ribbons that the members had won at the Texas State Fair for their jalape�o pepper entries. More than forty shadow boxes all reminding the members of their history and their responsibility for the upcoming year. Bless Cathy's heart for doing her part. She had a little garden of jalape�os on the east side of the lawn and nurtured them like children. The newest shadow box held ribbons that she'd earned for the club with her pepper jelly and picante. It was the soil, or maybe she told them bedtime stories, but she, like her mamma and grandma, grew the hottest jalape�os in the state.</p> <p>"It appears that Martha has decided to grace us with her presence once again when it is time to vote for someone to take our dear Prissy's place in the Blue-Ribbon Jalape�o Society. We really should amend our charter to state that a member has to attend more than one meeting every two years. You could appreciate the fact that we did amend it once to include you in the membership with your sister, who, by the way, has a spotless attendance record," Violet said.</p> <p>Violet, the queen of the club, as most of the members called it, was up near eighty years old, built like SpongeBob SquarePants, and had stovepipe jet-black hair right out of the bottle. Few people had the balls or the nerve to cross her, and those who did were put on her shit list right under Martha, aka Marty, Andrews's name, which was always on the top.</p> <p>Back in the beginning of the club days, before Marty was even born, the mayor's wife held the top position on the shit list. When they'd formed the Blue-Ribbon Jalape�o Society, Loretta Massey and Violet almost went to war over the name of the new club. Loretta insisted that it be called a society, and Violet wanted it to be called a club. Belonging to a club just sounded so much fancier than saying that one belonged to a society. Loretta won when the vote came in, but Violet called it a club anyway and that's what stuck. Rumor had it that Violet was instrumental in getting the mayor ousted just so they'd have to leave Grayson County and Loretta would have to quit the club.</p> <p>Marty hated it when people called her Martha. It sounded like an old woman's name. What was her mother thinking anyway when she looked down at two little identical twin baby daughters and named them after her mother and aunt-Martha and Catherine? Thank God she'd at least shortened their names to Marty and Cathy.</p> <p>Marty shrugged, and Violet snorted. Granted, it was a ladylike snort, but it still went right along with her round face and three-layered neck. Hell, if they wanted to write forty amendments to the charter, Marty would still do only the bare necessities to keep her in voting standing. She hadn't even wanted to be in the damned club and had only done it because if she didn't, then Cathy couldn't.</p> <p>Marty slid into a seat beside her sister and held up her ballot.</p> <p>Beulah had the bowl in hand and was ready to hand it off to Violet to read off the votes. But she passed it to the lady on the other side of her and it went back around the circle to Marty, who tossed in her folded piece of paper. If she'd done her homework and gotten the numbers right, that one vote should swing the favor for Anna Ruth to be the new member of the club. She didn't like Anna Ruth, especially since she'd broken up her best friend's marriage. But hey, Marty had made a deathbed promise to her mamma, and that carried more weight than the name of a hussy on a piece of paper.</p> <p>The bowl went back to Violet and she put it in her lap like the coveted jeweled crown of a reigning queen. "Our amended charter states that only twenty-one women can belong to the Blue-Ribbon Jalape�o Society at any one time, and the only time we vote a new member in is when someone moves or dies. Since Prissy Parnell got married this past week and moved away from Grayson County, we are open for one new member. The four names on the ballot are: Agnes Flynn, Trixie Matthews, Anna Ruth Williams, and Gloria Rawlings."</p> <p>Even though it wasn't in the fine print, everyone knew that when attending a meeting, the members should dress for the occasion, which meant panty hose and heels. Marty could feel nineteen pairs of eyes on her. It would have been twenty, but Violet was busy fishing the first ballot from the fancy bowl.</p> <p>Marty threw one long leg over the other and let the bright red, three-inch-heeled shoe dangle on her toe. They could frown all they wanted. She was wearing a dress, even if it only reached midthigh, and had black spandex leggings under it. If they wanted her to wear panty hose, they'd better put a second amendment on that charter and make it in big print.</p> <p>God Almighty, but she'd be glad when her great-aunt died and she could quit the club. But it looked like Agnes was going to last forever, which was no surprise. God sure didn't want her in heaven, and the devil wouldn't have her in hell.</p> <p>"One vote for Agnes," Violet said aloud.</p> <p>Beulah marked that down on the minutes and waited.</p> <p>Violet enjoyed her role as president of the club and took her own sweet time with each ballot. Too bad she hadn't dropped dead or at least moved to California so Cathy could be president. Marty would bet her sister would get those votes counted a hell of a lot faster.</p> <p>There was one piece of paper in the candy dish when Beulah held up a hand. "We've got six each for Agnes, Trixie, Anna Ruth, and two for Gloria. Unless this last vote is for Agnes, Trixie, or Anna Ruth, we have a tie, and we'll have to have a runoff election."</p> <p>"Shit!" Marty mumbled.</p> <p>Cathy shot her a dirty look.</p> <p>"Anna Ruth," Violet said and let out a whoosh of air.</p> <p>A smile tickled the corner of Marty's mouth.</p> <p>Saved, by damn!</p> <p>Agnes was saved from prison.</p> <p>Violet was saved from attending her own funeral.</p> <p>The speeding ticket was worth every penny.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Trixie poked the black button beside the nursing home door and kicked yellow and orange leaves away as she reached for the handle. She heard the familiar click as the lock let go and then heard someone yell her name.</p> <p>"Hey, Trixie. Don't shut it. We are here," Cathy called out.</p> <p>Trixie waved at her two best friends: Cathy and Marty Andrews. Attitude and hair color kept them from being identical. They were five feet ten inches tall and slim built, but Cathy kept blond highlights in her brown hair and Marty's was natural. In attitude, they were as different as vanilla and chocolate. Cathy was the sweet twin who loved everyone and had trouble speaking her mind. Marty was the extrovert who called the shots like she saw them. Cathy was engaged, and Marty said there were too many cowboys she hadn't taken to bed to get herself tied down to one man.</p> <p>Marty threw an arm around Trixie's shoulder as they marched down the wide hall. Trixie's mother, Janie Matthews, had checked herself into the nursing home four years before when her Alzheimer's had gotten so bad that she didn't know Trixie one day. Trixie had tried to talk her mother into living with her, but Janie was lucid enough to declare that she couldn't live alone and her daughter had to work.</p> <p>"Congratulations, darlin', you did not make it into the club tonight. Your life has been spared until someone dies or moves away and Cathy nominates you again," Marty said.</p> <p>"Well, praise the Lord," Trixie said.</p> <p>"I know. Let's string Cathy up by her toenails and force-feed her fried potatoes until her wedding dress won't fit for even putting your name in the pot." Marty laughed.</p> <p>"Trixie would be a wonderful addition to the club. She wouldn't let Violet run her around like a windup toy. That's why I keep nominating her every chance I get," Cathy said. "Anna Ruth is going to be a brand-new puppet in Violet's hands. Every bit as bad as Gloria would have been."</p> <p>Trixie stopped so fast that Marty's hand slipped off her shoulder. "Anna Ruth?"</p> <p>"Sorry." Cathy shrugged. "I'm surprised that she won and she only did by one vote."</p> <p>Trixie did a head wiggle. "Don't the world turn around? My mamma wasn't fit for the club because she had me out of wedlock. And now Anna Ruth is living with my husband without a marriage certificate and she gets inducted. If she has a baby before they marry, do they have a big divorce ceremony and kick her out?"</p> <p>"I never thought she'd get it," Cathy said. "I don't know how in the world I'm going to put up with her in club, knowing that she's the one that broke up your marriage."</p> <p>Trixie paled. "Who's going to tell Agnes that she didn't get it again? Lord, she's going to be an old bear all week."</p> <p>"That's Beulah's job. She nominated her. I'm just damn glad I have a class tonight. Maybe the storm will be over before I get home," Marty said.</p> <p>Cathy smiled weakly. "And I've got dinner with Ethan back at Violet's in an hour."</p> <p>"I'm not even turning on the lights when I get home. Maybe she'll think I've died." Trixie started walking again.</p> <p>"You okay with the Anna Ruth thing?" Marty asked.</p> <p>Trixie nodded. "Can't think of a better thing to happen to y'all's club."</p> <p>"It's not my club," Marty said. "I'm just there so Cathy can be in it. I'm not sure Violet would let her precious son marry a woman who wasn't in the al-damn-mighty Blue-Ribbon Jalape�o Society. I still can't believe that Violet is okay with her precious son marrying one of the Andrews twins."</p> <p>Cathy pointed a long slender finger at her sister. "Don't you start with me! And I'm not the feisty twin. You are. I can't see Violet letting Ethan marry you for sure."</p> <p>"Touchy, are we? Well, darlin' sister, I wouldn't have that man, mostly because I'd have to put up with Violet." Marty giggled.</p> <p>"Shhh, no fighting. It'll upset Mamma." Trixie rapped gently on the frame of the open door and poked her head inside a room. "Anyone at home?"</p> <p>Janie Matthews clapped her hands and her eyes lit up. She and Trixie were mirror images of each other-short, slim built, light brown hair, milk-chocolate-colored eyes, and delicate features. Trixie wore her hair in a chin-length bob, and Janie's was long, braided, and wrapped around her head in a crown. Other than that and a few wrinkles around Janie's eyes, they looked more like sisters than mother and daughter.</p> <p>"Why, Clawdy Burton, you've come to visit. Sit down, darlin', and let's talk. You aren't still mad at me, are you?"</p> <p>Marty crossed the room and sat down beside Janie on the bed, leaving the two chairs in the room for Cathy and Trixie. It wasn't the first time Janie had mistaken her for Claudia, the twins' mother, or the first time that she'd remembered Claudia by her maiden name, either.</p> <p>"I brought some friends," Marty said.</p> <p>"Any friend of Clawdy's is a friend of mine. Come right in here. You look familiar. Did you go to school with me and Clawdy?" Janie looked right at her daughter.</p> <p>"I did," Trixie said.</p> <p>Janie's brow furrowed. "I can't put a name with your face."</p> <p>"I'm Trixie."</p> <p>Janie shook her head. "Sorry, honey, I don't remember you. And you?" She looked into Cathy's eyes.</p> <p>"She's my sister, Cathy, remember?" Marty asked.</p> <p>"Well, ain't that funny. I never knew Clawdy to have a sister. You must be older than we are, but I can see the resemblance."</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am, I didn't know you as well as"-Cathy paused-"my little sister did, but I remember coming to your house."</p> <p>"Did Mamma make fried chicken for you?"</p> <p>"Oh, honey, I've eaten fried chicken more than once at your house," Cathy said.</p> <p>"Good. Mamma makes the best fried chicken in the whole world. She and Clawdy's mamma know how to do it just right. Now, Clawdy, tell me you aren't mad at me. I made a mistake runnin' off with Rusty like that, but we can be friends now, can't we?"</p> <p>Marty patted her on the arm. "You know I could never stay mad at you."</p> <p>"I'm just so glad you got my letter and came to visit." Janie looked at Trixie and drew her eyes down. "You look just like a girl I used to know. It's right there on the edge of my mind, but I've got this remembering disease. That's why I'm in here, so they can help me." She turned her attention back to Marty. "You really aren't mad at me anymore?"</p> <p>"Of course not. You were in love with Rusty or you wouldn't have run off with him," Marty said. They had this conversation often so she knew exactly what to say.</p> <p>"I did love him, but he found someone new, so I had to bring my baby girl and come on back home. How are your girls?" She jumped at least five years from thinking she and Claudia were in school to the time when they were new mothers.</p> <p>"They're fine. Let's talk about you," Marty said.</p> <p>Janie yawned. "Clawdy, darlin', I'm so sorry, but I can't keep my eyes open anymore."</p> <p>It was always the same. On Wednesday nights, Trixie visited with Janie. Sometimes, when they had time between closing the caf� and their other Wednesday evening plans, Marty and Cathy went with her. And always after fifteen or twenty minutes, on a good night, she was sleepy.</p> <p>"That's okay, Janie. We'll come see you again soon," Marty said.</p> <p>Trixie stopped at the doorway and waved.</p> <p>Janie frowned. "I'm sorry I can't remember you. You remind me of someone I knew a long time ago, but I can't recall your name. Were you the Jalape�o Jubilee queen this year? Maybe that's where I saw you."</p> <p>"No, ma'am. They don't crown queens anymore. But it's okay. I remember you real well," Trixie said.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Less than half an hour later, Trixie parked beside a big two-story house sitting on the corner of Main and Fourth in Cadillac, Texas. The sign outside the house said Miss Clawdy's Caf� in fancy lettering. Above it were the words: Red Beans and Turnip Greens.</p> <p>Most folks in town just called it Clawdy's.</p> <p>It had started as a joke after Cathy and Marty's mamma, Claudia, died and the three of them were going through her recipes. They'd actually been searching for "the secret," but evidently Claudia took it to the grave with her.</p> <p>More than forty years ago, Grayson County and Fannin County women were having a heated argument over who could grow the hottest jalape�os in North Texas. Idalou Thomas, over in Fannin County, had won the contest for her jalape�o ...</p></p><h2>The Greenhouse</h2><p>For Lobbi, the tragic passing of his mother proves to be a profound catalyst. Their shared love of tending rare roses in her greenhouse inspires him to leave his studies behind and travel to a remote village monastery to restore its once fabulous gardens. While transforming the garden under the watchful eye of a cinephile monk, he is surprised by a visit from Anna, a friend of a friend with whom he shared a fateful moment in his mother&#x2019;s greenhouse, and the daughter they together conceived that night. In caring for both the garden and the little girl, Lobbi slowly begins to assume the varied and complex roles of a man: fatherhood with a deep relationship with his child, cooking, nurturing, and remaining also a son, brother, lover, and...a gardener. A story about the heartfelt search for beauty in life, <em>The Greenhouse </em>is a touching reminder of our ability to turn the small things in everyday life into the extraordinary.</p><p><strong>A Q&amp;A with Audur Ava Olafsdottir </strong><br> <strong><br>Question:</strong> Are you a gardener yourself, or are the references to growth and cultivation in <em>The Greenhouse</em> intended as a metaphor for the protagonist&#x2019;s own growth and self-realization? <p><strong>Audur Ava Olafsdottir:</strong> I would like to be a gardener like my protagonist, Lobbi--"silent in the soil," so to speak. But really, I am just an author using my imagination as a tool. While I was writing <em>The Greenhouse</em>, my own garden in Reykjavik was neglected.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What inspired you to get inside the head of a twentysomething man?</p> <p><strong>AAO:</strong> The novel tells the story of a very young father who is "practically brought up in a greenhouse" and has three main interests in life: sex, death, and cultivating roses. The story focuses on his many complex roles as a son, a twin brother, a lover, and a father. I was particularly interested in fatherhood, which is in many ways an abstract experience--especially when you have a child with a stranger, like Lobbi does--compared to the woman's experience of giving birth. I like to play with traditional gender roles by talking about male sensitivity.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Lobbi tries to move on after his mother's death by taking a journey to restore the gardens of a remote monastery. Is the monastery he visits based on a real place?</p> <p><strong>AAO:</strong> Many people have asked me where the beautiful rose garden in the story is. I answer that the possibility of creating a garden and making it real is always there if you can make it grow in the reader's mind. That's how fiction works. My Lobbi is traveling through an unnamed country. As in all fictional travels, the narrator becomes acquainted with himself, rather than with a place.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Through Lobbi's grief-stricken eyes after the death of his mother, you paint Iceland as barren and desolate place. But how would you describe the country yourself?</p> <p><strong>AAO:</strong> The natural landscape is breathtaking. It is like being lost in space or in infinity, and it gives you the feeling of total freedom. Being an Icelander also means being part of a small community of 317,000 people and being constantly confronted with the unpredictable: weather, volcanic eruptions, bankruptcy. Being an Icelandic writer means expressing myself in a marginal language that no one understands.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You have a degree in art history and also work as a curator. How did you get into writing? Does your eye for art give you a different perspective?</p> <p><strong>AAO:</strong> I think the main impact of working full-time as an art historian is that there's a longer gap between books. But thousands of pictures have gone through my mind, and they probably have some influence on my writing. There's often a picture in my mind as a starting point, but while I'm writing, it disappears beneath layers of text.</p> <p>My view of the world has always been slightly skewed. Then, out of nowhere, I had this urge to create fictitious worlds with their own laws. Maybe it comes from a strong need for freedom. Like many writers, I want the world to be different, and writing novels is my small contribution to that.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Lobbi and Anna's daughter is an angelic creature--easy to care for and a positive influence on others. But you&#x2019;re a mother, and you know that child rearing can be far from easy. Why did you portray the baby that way?</p> <p><strong>AAO:</strong> Is not any child a miracle and fatherhood a wonderful opportunity?</p><strong>Audur Ava Olafsdottir</strong> was born in Reykjav�k, Iceland, in 1958.

In The Punishment Imperative, eminent criminologists Todd R. Clear and Natasha A. Frost argue that America&#x2019;s move to mass incarceration from the 1960s to the early 2000s was more than just a response to crime or a collection of policies adopted in isolation; it was a grand social experiment. Tracing a wide array of trends related to the criminal justice system, this book charts the rise of penal severity in America and speculates that a variety of forces&#x2014;fiscal, political, and evidentiary&#x2014;have finally come together to bring this great social experiment to an end. The authors stress that while the doubling of the crime rate in the late 1960s represented one of the most pressing social problems at the time, it was instead the way crime posed a political problem&#x2014;and thereby offered a political opportunity&#x2014;that became the basis for the great rise in punishment. Clear and Frost contend that the public&#x2019;s growing realization that the severe policies themselves, not growing crime rates, were the main cause of increased incarceration eventually led to a surge of interest in taking a more rehabilitative, pragmatic, and cooperative approach to dealing with criminal offenders that still continues to this day. Part historical study, part forward-looking policy analysis, The Punishment Imperative is a compelling study of a generation of crime and punishment in America.</p></p><p>Todd R. Clear is Provost at Rutgers University, Newark. He is the author of Imprisoning Communities and What Is Community Justice? And is the founding editor of the journal Criminology &amp; Public Policy.<br><br><b>Natasha A. Frost</b> is Associate Dean and Associate Professor in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. Her books include The Punitive State and Contemporary Issues in Crime and Justice Policy."For forty years, the heavy hammer of criminal punishment has been the nation's primary tool for addressing social problems. And when the hammer has failed to fix these problems or does further damage, we've responded by grabbing an even bigger hammer. In The Punishment Imperative, Todd Clear and Natasha Frost convincingly demonstrate that the hammer has, finally, become too heavy for us to raise. They offer a masterful dissection of this 'grand social experiment'; showing how we embarked on this strategy, its costs to individuals and communities, and a clear-headed path to real reform. The Punishment Imperative is neither armchair critique nor utopian vision, but rather an eye-opening and truly authoritative treatment by two true experts on punishment's past, present, and future." (Christopher Uggen,co-author of Locked Out: Felon Disenfranchisement and American Democracy)<br><br>"It is too soon to tell if a sea of change is upon the US penal system, but the authors make their cogent argument in this well-written book.

(Frances O. Sandiford <i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Criminologists Clear (Imprisoning Communities) and Frost (The Punitive State) offer an accessible study of mass incarceration in the U.S. that is theoretically sophisticated and rich in statistical data . . . .

(<i>Crime Law Social Change</i>)<br><br>"Backed up by the best science, Todd Clear and Natasha Frost make a compelling case for why the nations forty-year embrace of the punitive spirit has been morally bankrupt and endangered public safety. But this is far more than an expos� of correctional failure.

But the town of Woodstock, New York, the original planned venue of the concert, is located over 60 miles from the site to which the fabled half a million flocked. Long before the landmark music festival usurped the name, Woodstock-the tiny Catskills town where Bob Dylan holed up after his infamous 1966 motorcycle accident-was already a key location in the '60s rock landscape.<br><br>In <i>Small Town Talk</i>, Barney Hoskyns re-creates Woodstock's community of brilliant dysfunctional musicians, scheming dealers, and opportunistic hippie capitalists drawn to the area by Dylan and his sidekicks from the Band. Central to the book's narrative is the broodingly powerful presence of Albert Grossman, manager of Dylan, the Band, Janis Joplin, Paul Butterfield, and Todd Rundgren-and the Big Daddy of a personal fiefdom in Bearsville that encompassed studios, restaurants, and his own record label. Intertwined in the story are the Woodstock experiences and associations of artists as diverse as Van Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Tim Hardin, Karen Dalton, and Bobby Charles (whose immortal song-portrait of Woodstock gives the book its title).<br><br>Drawing on numerous first-hand interviews with the remaining key players in the scene-and on the period when he lived there himself in the 1990s-Hoskyns has produced an East Coast companion to his bestselling L.A. canyon classic <i>Hotel California</i>. This is a richly absorbing study of a vital music scene in a revolutionary time and place.<br></p><p><b>Barney Hoskyns</b> is a music historian, editorial director of the online music-journalism library Rock's Backpages, and author of <i>Hotel California</i>, <i>Lowside of the Road: A Life of Tom Waits</i>, and an oral history of Led Zeppelin.

In the weeks following the victim&#x2019;s death, his sister, Meghan, and her lover a sometime literary forger whose specialty is the handwriting of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle struggle to come to terms with the murder. The police fail to identify a likely suspect, and the case quickly turns cold. Soon, Meghan&#x2019;s lover begins to receive threatening handwritten letters, ostensibly penned by long-dead authors but really from someone who seems to have disturbing insights into Adam&#x2019;s death. Understanding that his own life is in jeopardy, he attempts to forge a new beginning for himself and Meghan.

That&#x2019;s nothing new to postmistress Mary Minor &#x201c;Harry&#x201d; Haristeen and her friends, who keep warm with hard work, hot toddies, and rabid rooting for the University of Virginia&#x2019;s women&#x2019;s basketball team at the old stadium affectionately dubbed &#x201c;The Clam.&#x201d; But the usual postgame high spirits are laid low when contractor H. H. Donaldson drops dead in the parking lot. And pretty soon word has spread that it wasn&#x2019;t a heart attack that did him in. It just doesn&#x2019;t sit right with Harry that one of her fellow fans--perhaps even an acquaintance or neighbor sitting close by in the stands--is a murderer. And as tiger cat Mrs. Murphy is all too aware, things that don&#x2019;t sit right with Harry make her restless, curious, and prone to poking her not-very-sensitive human nose into dangerous places. So the animals start paying closer attention to what the people around them are doing--and they&#x2019;re the first ones to realize when the next murder occurs.<br><br>It seems obvious to Harry that the deaths are connected--and she intends to find out exactly how. There&#x2019;s no shortage of suspects, considering that H.H. was a ladies&#x2019; man who&#x2019;d left a trail of broken hearts all over town--the most recent belonging to his wife-- and that the second murder victim was not very popular in Crozet.As the police launch their investigation, Harry picks up clues through savvy questioning of everyone she knows. But it&#x2019;s the critters who are most attuned to trouble--they scent something wicked wafting Harry&#x2019;s way on the tail of the next snowstorm. And as Harry draws closer to the truth about a brutal killer, Mrs. Murphy and her friends realize it&#x2019;s up to them to make sure their intrepid mom lands on her feet.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Murphy is [a] cat who detects her way into our hearts.&#x201d;<br>--<i>San Francisco Chronicle Book Review<br></i><br><i>From the eBook edition.</i><b>Rita Mae Brown&nbsp;</b>is the bestselling author of the Sneaky Pie Brown series; the Sister Jane series;&nbsp;<i>A Nose for Justice&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Murder Unleashed; Rubyfruit Jungle; In Her Day;&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Six of One,&nbsp;</i>as well as several other novels.

Born near San Francisco in 1915 and raised in Ontario, Millar returned to the U.S. as a young man and published his first novel in 1944. He served as the president of the Mystery Writers of America and was awarded their Grand Master Award as well as the Mystery Writers of Great Britain&#39;s Gold Dagger Award. He died in 1983.chapter 1THERE WAS LIGHT early morning traffic on Sepulveda. As I drove over the low pass, the sun came up glaring behind the blue crags on the far side of the valley. For a minute or two, before regular day set in, everything looked fresh and new and awesome as creation.I left the freeway at Canoga Park and stopped at a drive-in for a ninety-nine-cent breakfast. Then I went on up to the Sebastians' place in Woodland Hills.Keith Sebastian had given me detailed instructions on how to find his house. It was an angular contemporary house cantilevered out over a slope. The slope ran steeply down to the edge of a golf course, green from the first of the winter rains.Keith Sebastian came out of the house in shirt sleeves. He was a handsome man of forty or so, with thick curly brown hair frosted at the sides. He hadn't shaved yet, and his growth of beard looked like fibrous dirt that his lower face had been rubbed in."It's good of you to come right out," he said when I had introduced myself. "I realize it's an ungodly hour--""You didn't pick it, and I don't mind. I gather she hasn't come home yet.""No, she hasn't. Since I called you I've found out something else is missing. My shotgun, and a box of shells.""You think your daughter took them?""I'm afraid she must have. The gun cabinet wasn't broken, and nobody else knew where the key to it was. Except my wife, of course."Mrs. Sebastian had appeared as if on cue at the open front door. She was thin and dark and rather beautiful in a haggard sort of way, and she was wearing fresh lipstick and a fresh yellow linen dress."Come in," she said to both of us. "It's cold out."She made a shivery self-hugging gesture which didn't end when it should have. She went on shivering."This is Mr. Lew Archer," Sebastian was saying. "The private detective I called." He spoke as if he was presenting me to her as a kind of peace offering.She answered him impatiently: "I guessed that. Come in, I've made some coffee."I sat between them at the kitchen counter and drank the bitter brew from a thin cup. The place seemed very clean and very empty. The light pouring in through the window had a cruel clarity."Can Alexandria fire a shotgun?" I asked them. "Anybody can," Sebastian said glumly. "All you have to do is pull the trigger."His wife cut in. "Actually Sandy's a fair shot. The Hacketts took her quail hunting earlier this year. Much against my wishes, I might add.""You might and did," Sebastian said. "I'm sure the experience was good for her.""She hated it. She said so in her diary. She hates to kill things.""She'll get over it. And I know it gave pleasure to Mr. and Mrs. Hackett.""Here we go again."But before they did, I said: "Who in hell are Mr. and Mrs. Hackett?"Sebastian gave me a self-revealing look, partly offended, partly patronizing."Mr. Stephen Hackett is my boss. That is, he controls the holding company that controls the savings and loan company I work for. He owns quite a few other things, too.""Including you," his wife said. "But not my daughter.""That's unfair, Bernice. I never said--""It's what you do that counts."I got up and walked around to the other side of the counter and stood facing them. They both looked a little startled and ashamed."All this is very interesting," I said. "But I didn't get out of bed at five o'clock in the morning to referee a family argument. Let's concentrate on your daughter Sandy. How old is she, Mrs. Sebastian?""Seventeen. She's in her senior year."Doing well?""She was until the last few months. Then her grades started slipping, quite badly.""Why?"She looked down into her coffee cup. "I don't really know why." She sounded evasive, unwilling even to give herself an answer."Of course you know why," her husband said. "All this has happened since she took up with that wild man. Davy what's-his-name.""He isn't a man. He's a nineteen-year-old boy and we handled the whole thing abominably.""What whole thing, Mrs. Sebastian?"She held out her arms as if she was trying to encompass the situation, then dropped them in despair. "The business of the boy. We mishandled it.""She means I did, as usual," Sebastian said. "But I only did what I had to do. Sandy was starting to run wild. Skipping school to have afternoon dates with this fellow. Spending her nights on the Strip and God knows where else. Last night I went out and hunted them down&#x2014;"His wife interrupted him. "It wasn't last night. It was the night before last.""Whenever it was." His voice seemed to be weakening under the steady cold force of her disapproval. It shifted gears, to a kind of chanting shout. "I hunted them down in a weird joint in West Hollywood. They were sitting there in public with their arms around each other. I told him if he didn't stay away from my daughter I'd take my shotgun and blow his bloody head off.""My husband watches a good deal of television," Mrs. Sebastian said dryly."Make fun of me if you want to, Bernice. Somebody had to do what I did. My daughter was running wild with a criminal. I brought her home and locked her in her room. What else could a man do?"His wife was silent for once. She moved her fine dark head slowly from side to side.I said: "Do you know the young man is a criminal?""He served time in the county jail for auto theft.""Joy riding," she said."Call it what you like. It wasn't a first offense, either.""How do you know?""Bernice read it in her diary."I'd like to see this famous diary.""No," Mrs. Sebastian said. "It was bad enough for me to have read it. I shouldn't have." She took a deep breath. "We haven't been very good parents, I'm afraid. I'm just as much to blame as my husband is, in subtler ways. But you don't want to go into that.""Not now." I was weary of the war of the generations, the charges and countercharges, the escalations and negotiations, the endless talk across the bargaining table. "How long has your daughter been gone?"Sebastian looked at his wrist watch. "Nearly twenty-three hours. I let her out of her room yesterday morning. She seemed to have calmed down&#x2014;""She was furious," her mother said. "But I never thought when she started out for school that she had no intention of going there. We didn't really catch on until about six o'clock last night when she didn't come home for dinner. Then I got in touch with her homeroom teacher and found out she'd been playing hooky all day. By that time it was dark already."She looked at the window as if it was still dark, now and forever. I followed her glance. Two people were striding along the fairway, a man and a woman, both white-haired, as if they'd grown old in the quest for their small white ball."One thing I don't understand," I said. "If you thought she was going to school yesterday morning, what about the gun?""She must have put it in the trunk of her car," Sebastian said."I see. She's driving a car.""That's one of the reasons we're so concerned." Sebastian pushed his face forward across the counter. I felt like a bartender being consulted by a drunk. But it was fear he was drunk on. "You've had some experience in these matters. Why would she take my shotgun, for heaven's sake?""I can think of one possible reason, Mr. Sebastian. You told her you'd blow her friend's head off with it.""But she couldn't have taken me seriously.""I do.""So do I," his wife said.Sebastian hung his head like a prisoner in the dock. But he said under his breath: "By God, I will kill him if he doesn't bring her back.""Good thinking, Keith," his wife said.chapter 2THE FRICTION BETWEEN the two was starting to rasp on my nerves. I asked Sebastian to show me his gun cabinet. He took me into a small study which was partly library and partly gun room.There were light and heavy rifles standing upright behind glass in the mahogany gun cabinet, and an empty slot where a double-barreled shotgun had fitted. The bookshelves held a collection of best sellers and book-club editions, and one drab row of textbooks in economics and advertising psychology."Are you in advertising?""Public relations. I'm chief PR officer for Centennial Savings and Loan. Actually I should be there this morning. We're deciding on our program for next year.""It can wait one day, can't it?""I don't know."He turned to the gun cabinet, opening it and the drawer under it where he kept his shells. They unlocked with the same brass key."Where was the key?""In the top drawer of my desk." He opened the drawer and showed me. "Sandy knew where I kept it, of course.""But anybody else could easily have found it.""That's true. But I'm sure she took it.""Why?""I just have a feeling.""Is she gun-happy?""Certainly not. When you're properly trained in the use of guns, you don't become gun-happy, as you call it.""Who trained her?""I did, naturally. I'm her father."He went to the gun cabinet and touched the barrel of the heavy rifle. Carefully he closed the glass door and locked it. He must have caught his reflection in the glass. He backed away from it, scouring his bearded chin with his cupped palm."I look terrible. No wonder Bernice has been picking at me. My face is coming apart."He excused himself and went away to put his face together. I took a peek at my own face in the glass. I didn't look too happy. Early morning was not my best thinking time, but I formulated a vague unhappy thought: Sandy was middle girl in a tense marriage, and at the moment I was middle man.Mrs. Sebastian came softly into the room and stood beside me in front of the gun cabinet."I married a boy scout," she said."There are sorrier fates.""Name one. My mother warned me not to take up with a good-looking man. Marry brains, she told me. But I wouldn't listen. I should have stuck with my modeling career. At least I can depend on my own bones." She patted the hip nearest me."You have good bones. Also, you're very candid.""I got that way in the course of the night.""Show me your daughter's diary.""I will not.""Are you ashamed of her?""Of myself," she said. "What could the diary tell you that I can't tell you?""If she was sleeping with this boy, for instance.""Of course she wasn't," she said with a little flash of anger."Or anybody else.""That's absurd." But her face went sallow."Was she?""Of course not. Sandy's remarkably innocent for her age."Or was. Let's hope she still is."Bernice Sebastian retreated to higher ground. "I&#x2014;we didn't hire you to pry into my daughter's morals.""You didn't hire me, period. In a chancy case like this, I need a retainer, Mrs. Sebastian.""What do you mean, chancy?""Your daughter could come home at any time. Or you and your husband could change your minds&#x2014;"She stopped me with an impatient flick of her hand. "All right, how much do you want?""Two days' pay and expenses, say two hundred and fifty." She sat at the desk, got a checkbook out of the second drawer, and wrote me a check. "What else?""Some recent pictures of her.""Sit down, I'll get you some."When she was gone, I examined the checkbook stubs. After paying me my retainer, the Sebastians had less than two hundred dollars left in their bank account. Their smart new house cantilevered over a steep drop was an almost perfect image of their lives.Mrs. Sebastian came back with a handful of pictures. Sandy was a serious-looking girl who resembled her mother in her dark coloring. Most of the pictures showed her doing things: riding a horse, riding a bicycle, standing on a diving board ready to dive, pointing a gun. The gun looked like the same .22 rifle as the one in the gun cabinet. She held it as if she knew how to use it."What about this gun bit, Mrs. Sebastian? Was it Sandy's idea?""It was Keith's. His father brought him up to hunt. Keith passed on the great tradition to his daughter." Her voice was sardonic."Is she your only child?""That's right. We have no son."May I go through her room?"The woman hesitated. "What do you expect to find? Evidence of transvestitism? Narcotics?"She was still trying to be sardonic, but the questions came through literally to me. I'd found stranger things than those in young people's rooms.Sandy's room was full of sunlight and fresh sweet odors. I found pretty much what you'd expect to find in the bedroom of an innocent, serious high-school senior. A lot of sweaters and skirts and books, both high-school books and a few good novels like A High Wind in Jamaica. A menagerie of cloth animals. College pennants, mostly Ivy League. A pink-frilled vanity with cosmetics laid out on the top of it in geometrical patterns. The photograph of another young girl smiling from a silver frame on the wall."Who's that?""Sandy's best friend, Heidi Gensler.""I'd like to talk to her."Mrs. Sebastian hesitated. These hesitations of hers were brief but tense and somber, as if she was planning her moves far ahead in a high-stakes game."The Genslers don't know about this," she said."You can't look for your daughter and keep it a secret both at the same time. Are the Genslers friends of yours?""They're neighbors. The two girls are the real friends." She made her decision suddenly. "I'll ask Heidi to drop over before she goes to school.""Why not right away?"She left the room. I made a quick search of possible hiding places, under the pink oval lamb's-wool rug, between the mattress and springs, on the high dark shelf in the closet, behind and under the clothes in the chest of drawers. I shook out some of the books. From the center of Sonnets from the Portuguese a scrap of paper fluttered.I picked it up from the rug. It was part of a lined notebook page on which someone had written in precise black script:<i>Listen, bird, you give me a painIn my blood swinging about.I think I better open a veinAnd let you bloody well out.</i></p><h2>BIGLAW: A Novel</h2><p><b>*Chosen one of the Best Books of 2015 by&nbsp;<i>Good Housekeeping&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Redbook</i>*</b><b>*A Harper's Bazaar Must-Read*</b><b>*Film and TV Rights Optioned to Paramount*</b><b>*A 2015 USA Best Book Award Winner*</b><br><br><b>As featured in:</b><br><br><b>Huffington Post Books, Harper's Bazaar Magazine, Bloomberg BNA, Vault,&nbsp;<i>Working Mother Magazine, Chicago Tribune, The New York times,&nbsp;</i></b><b><i>Redbook Magazine, Good Housekeeping Magazine:&nbsp;</i>20 Best Books by Women in 2015,&nbsp;</b><b><i>BuzzFeed: </i>September Reads You Must Find Time For<i>, San Francisco Book Review: </i>Best Books for Sweater Weather,&nbsp;<i>Sheknows.com: </i>Most Anticipated Novels of Fall, <i>Culturalist</i>: Best Book Club Reads, <i>YourTango</i>: Incredible Books Every Smart Woman Should Read this Fall</b><br><br>The&nbsp;<i>Devil Wears Prada&nbsp;</i>meets&nbsp;<i>One L, BIGLAW</i>&nbsp;provides an insider's view of the cut-throat world of big New York law firms.<br><br>Mackenzie Corbett has always dreamed of living in New York City.

In Forms of Rockin', graffiti styles are connected to graphic design and other popular culture expressions such as music, fashion, photography, industrial design and movies for the first time. Anssi Arte analyses some of the most powerful visual symbols of the 1970s, 80s and 90s and compares design, typography and graffiti styles.

Chronicles a cattle drive in the nineteenth century from Texas to Montana, and follows the lives of Gus and Call, the cowboys heading the drive, Gus&#39;s woman, Lorena, and Blue Duck, a sinister Indian renegade.</p><p>Larry McMurtry, in books like The Last Picture Show, has depicted the modern degeneration of the myth of the American West. The subject of <b>Lonesome Dove</b>, cowboys herding cattle on a great trail-drive, seems like the very stuff of that cliched myth, but McMurtry bravely tackles the task of creating meaningful literature out of it. At first the novel seems the kind of anti-mythic, anti-heroic story one might expect: the main protagonists are a drunken and inarticulate pair of former Texas Rangers turned horse rustlers. Yet when the trail begins, the story picks up an energy and a drive that makes heroes of these men. Their mission may be historically insignificant, or pointless--McMurtry is smart enough to address both possibilities--but there is an undoubted valor in their lives. The result is a historically aware, intelligent, romantic novel of the mythic west that won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.<b>Larry McMurtry </b>is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays.

Decorated and Englished in Prosaic Verse by Alasdair Gray</h2><p>It took Alasdair Gray, &#x201c;[t]he best Scottish novelist since Sir Walter Scott&#x201d; (Anthony Burgess), more than thirty years to write Lanark, described by The Observer as &#x201c;probably the greatest novel of the century.&#x201d; Upon its publication in the U.S. in 1985, The New York Times described it, in its Notable Books year-end review, as &#x201c;a quirky, crypto-Calvinist Divine Comedy" that "should be widely read.&#x201d; <br><br>Now, more than thirty years later, Gray has translated and illustrated the Divine Comedy itself. One of the masterpieces of world literature, completed in 1320, Dante&#x2019;s Divina Commedia describes Dante&#x2019;s journey through Hell, Purgatory and his eventual arrival in Heaven.

Wheel Of Time 8: 8/12</h2><p>Path of Daggers</p><p>Robert Jordan's bestselling Wheel of Time epic is one of the most popular fantasy series of all time for a reason. Jordan's world is rich and complex, and he's assembled an endearing, involving core of characters while mapping out an ambitious and engaging story arc.<p> But with the previous book, <i>Crown of Swords</i>, and now with <i>Path of Daggers</i>, the series is in a bit of a holding pattern. <i>Path</i> continues the halting gait of the current plot line: Rand is still on the brink of losing it, all the while juggling the political machinations around him and again taking to the field against the Seanchan. The rest of the Two Rivers kids and company don't seem to be moving much faster. Egwene continues to slowly consolidate her hold as the "true" Amyrlin (finally getting closer to Tar Valon and the inevitable confrontation with Elaida), and Nynaeve and Elayne keep on wandering toward the Lion Throne, again on the run from the Seanchan. Mat Cauthon is barely mentioned, and fellow <i>ta'veren</i> Perrin keeps busy with politics in Ghealdan.

From his early years as a keen cyclist in his hometown in Colorado to his unflinching rite of passage as a professional rider with US Postal to his elevation as one of cycling's most resilient, ethical and intelligent team bosses, the highs and lows of his career have mirrored those of the sport itself. Vaughters has had a front-row seat for most of the major events in cycling over the past three decades. He was both a former teammate of Lance and a leading witness against him. And he went on to renounce doping and start the first pro cycling team to dedicate itself to clean riding, which has grown into one of the most successful teams competing today and started a movement that has swept across the sport.<br><br>This is also not simply a story of races won and lost: Vaughters shows readers how he navigated the complex, international business of building Slipstream into a world-class cycling team. Over the past decade, he has led the sport out of the scandal-plagued Armstrong era. By presenting the world with a team made of talented racers built around a rigorous approach to clean racing, he set a new standard within cycling that has since spread across the peloton. Written from the unique perspective of both a racer and a team manager, <i>One-Way Ticket</i> gives the complete story of what it takes to build a winning team and repair the reputation of a sport.</p><p><b>Jonathan Vaughters</b> began his cycling career in Colorado, eventually racing alongside Lance Armstrong on the infamous US Postal Service team. In the wake of the doping scandals that have plagued the sport, he founded what has become the US-based EF Education First Pro Cycling Team, which he still manages as it competes at cycling's highest level.<b>1</b><br> <b>Dead Last</b><br> I&#x2019;m not really sure why I signed up for my first bike race.<br> I was crap at school, and crap at sports. I had very little coordination, very small muscles, and was a good six inches shorter than the next smallest kid in my class. Athletic would be the last term anyone used to describe me. In short, I had the academic and athletic talent of a rain-soaked worm. <br> So how, or even why, at 12 years old, I decided to make bike racing my big adventure, I have no idea. But it happened. <br> On an early July morning in 1986 my parents drove me from beige, suburban Denver up to scenic, blue-skied Boulder. I was racing in the Red Zinger Mini Classic, a week-long stage race for kids, fashioned after the famous Coors Classic stage race. <br> The opening stage was a time trial. I wasn&#x2019;t really familiar with the discipline, and wondered if just riding on a lonely road, all by myself, was really what I signed up for. <br> Noticing how nervous and focused my competitors were, I retreated to the back of my parent&#x2019;s station wagon and wrestled with Angie, our cuddly Bedlington Terrier. Perhaps I was more of a bike <i>rider</i> than a bike <i>racer</i>? Sure, I loved riding my bike around to visit friends and girls I had crushes on. But racing to win? These kids looked bigger, meaner, stronger. They looked like hungry wolves to me. <br> I timidly rolled over to the start line, honestly not understanding what I was in for. It seemed simple enough: ride five miles, from A to B, as fast as you can. Yet, as is my nature, I&#x2019;d overthought the whole ordeal, and feltlike sliding back to the family Oldsmobile and asking Mum and Dad to take me home.<br> But off I went, riding into the unknown territory of a solo race against the clock on Highway 36. Very soon after the start, some other rider went zipping past me. And then, soon after that, so did another. This bike racing deal matched the absolute lack of success of athletic exploits I&#x2019;d experienced to date in my life.<br> I was slow. Very slow.<br> We had set off in alphabetical order, and a few riders behind me, was<br> Chris Wherry.<br> Wherry was a tall, handsome legend in 12-year-old Colorado bike racing folklore. He&#x2019;d won just about every race he entered and he commanded respect, even amongst the other 12-year-old &#x201c;superstars,&#x201d; hovering in the dirt parking lot that served as the start line.<br> Of course, soon enough he came whizzing past me, on his way to winning another race.<br> As he passed me, he yelled out: &#x201c;<i>Come on, dude! You gotta try a bit</i><br> <i>harder!&#x201d;</i><br> It was quite embarrassing. Duly, I did attempt to up the pace and keep up with him, for all of about 100 feet. He left me gasping and wincing, half in shame and half in pain.<br> I dragged myself across the finish line. I knew I hadn&#x2019;t done very well, but I figured I hadn&#x2019;t been caught by Wherry too quickly, so maybe I&#x2019;d finish somewhere in the middle of the 12 year-old category. I was being a bit too optimistic.<br> My parents had brought a picnic to eat in between the morning time trial and the afternoon criterium race. We sat with all the other families patiently waiting for the results of the morning time trial to come in.<br> I ate a Bologna and cheese sandwich and slurped down a soda, all the while secretly feeding Angie scraps of the sandwich that I wasn&#x2019;t fond of.<br> Finally, they posted a sheet on the side of an outhouse in the park.<br> My father and I reluctantly strolled over to see how I&#x2019;d fared. Over all the craning necks and taller heads, I finally spotted my name&#x2014;at the very bottom of the list.<br> The very last spot.<br> I was crushed and embarrassed to even be there. I wanted to go home.<br> I wanted to leave, immediately.<br> This was just the same as everything else I&#x2019;d tried. I wasn&#x2019;t any good at it. Just like school, just like games on the playground, just like trying to fit in. I failed at all of them, and now I was a failure at bike racing too. I just wasn&#x2019;t any good&#x2014;at anything.<br> I spoke to my mother and told her I wanted to leave, immediately. I had no business being there. She was a sympathetic ear, just listening as I recounted how poor I was at bike racing, and that maybe I just needed to leave and go home.<br> Angie sensed that I was upset. She came over and started giving me little doggie kisses, trying to understand what was wrong. I gave her a long hug and hoped that we&#x2019;d just get going, far away from this place and these people.<br> Meanwhile, my mother and father were locked in conversation about something. It was clearly a heated discussion and I watched as Dad waved his arms around.<br> My parents were never sports-minded. My father is an attorney with an acute love for the constitution of the United States, and a very strong sense of fairness. His love for reading and for justice was very strong and something he passed on to me. He loved helping people and going above and beyond to protect the rights of his clients.<br> He was well-liked and respected. Often, we&#x2019;d be given firewood, chicken meat, or help around the house in lieu of payment for bills that his clients couldn&#x2019;t afford, clients that he had opted to represent anyway. He was driven by the concept of equality for all, not by a love of money.<br> My mother taught children with learning disabilities and speech pathology.<br> She had wanted to become a medical doctor, but her grandfather, an MD himself, had convinced her otherwise, saying that medicine was no place for a woman. That decision, to not pursue medicine, never stopped bothering her.<br> Nevertheless, she managed to be very progressive for a woman who came of age in the chauvinistic 1950s, getting her master&#x2019;s degree in speech pathology and focusing on her career, first.<br> She had married a younger man late in life, and didn&#x2019;t have me until she was 38 years old. My parents were a formidable unit of intellectual horsepower, but their kid, competing in sports&#x2014;particularly such an odd niche sport like cycling&#x2014;was an unknown to them.<br> I sat on the grass, watching them argue, until finally, they agreed, which&#x2014; knowing how decisive and combative my mother was&#x2014;meant we were about to pack up the car and go back home.<br> Instead, my father walked over and firmly stated that we were staying, and I was going to start the afternoon&#x2019;s race. I was stunned and protested to him with all my might.<br> Dad is a gentle soul, not predisposed to drawing hard lines about anything.<br> He has an uncanny ability to see both sides of any issue. He would cede mostly to the more decisive nature of my mother, or even myself.<br> But not on that day.<br> He sat me down.<br> &#x201c;If you start something, you damn well finish it,&#x201d; he said firmly.<br> &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t matter if you&#x2019;re best or worst, you don&#x2019;t just quit. You&#x2019;re going to start the afternoon race, and you&#x2019;re going to try your best.&#x201d;<br> I was shocked.<br> &#x201c;I paid a lot for you to do this damned thing, so you aren&#x2019;t just quitting,&#x201d; he said exasperatedly. &#x201c;No way.&#x201d;<br> My Dad was the ever-supportive bear that never pushed back on anything. It was the first time my father had ever forced me to do something. And that one decision of his changed my entire life.<br> Later that afternoon, I begrudgingly started stage two of the Red Zinger, assuming I would just get slaughtered and lapped very quickly. I didn&#x2019;t want to be there and I didn&#x2019;t want to race. But I did, frown and all.<br> That start gun fired, and I struggled to quickly get my loose foot into the toe clips and toe straps on my bike. I&#x2019;d fought my way back into the peloton of puberty by the end of the first short lap. Somehow this wasn&#x2019;t as terrible as I had thought, and going around the corners at such speed was sort of fun. I was actually enjoying myself.<br> Despite the fact I was the worst bike racer there, I liked it. It was a far cry from trying to play football at recess, and just hating every moment of it. No, this was different; sure, I sucked, but I loved it.<br> Screaming around the corners, right on the edge of losing control, fueled my adrenaline and made my heart sing. I focused hard on the wheel in front of me, and never let it go. That task became harder and harder every lap, but I gritted my teeth and refused to let go.<br> One by one, I started passing kids that couldn&#x2019;t hang on to the back of the peloton. While they looked much better on the bike than I did and were, I&#x2019;m sure, much fitter than I was, I was able to suffer&#x2014;to tear my guts up just that little bit more&#x2014;to hold on. Twenty minutes earlier, I didn&#x2019;t even want to be there; now I was having the time of my life. And that was a new experience for me.<br> In the period of riding just a few laps, zipping around some anonymous office park outside Boulder, I changed my mind on sports.<br> I wanted to be an athlete.<br> I wanted to be a racer.<br> Racing absorbed me. It combined mental, technical, tactical, and physical aspects. Somehow, the balance of carving a corner on a machine worked much better than the eye to hand coordination of catching a ball. The circular motion of pushing the pedals made more sense to my overly cerebral brain than did the supposedly &#x201c;natural&#x201d; motion of running. I had fallen in love with racing a bike. I was still disgracefully slow and unfit, but I desperately wanted to be good.<br> That week, day by day, stage by stage, I got a little bit better at racing. I learned how to take a corner, how to draft closer, how to move up in a peloton. I wanted to fight as hard as I could to be a bit better, even though I was still very far away from winning anything.<br> For the first time in my life, I wasn&#x2019;t giving up when things got rough.<br> In school, in other sports, and in life, I had shown very little natural aptitude for anything beyond memorizing random facts about the American civil war. Until then, when things didn&#x2019;t come naturally to me, I gave up.<br> Deep down, I was competitive, but I had never let it show. I just wasn&#x2019;t that great at the stuff most parents, and most kids, wanted to be good at.<br> Football, baseball, basketball&#x2014;anything to do with a ball, I was simply shit. I was very small and near-sighted, so most automatically assumed I&#x2019;d be a good student, but my grades were miserable, too.<br> But then came cycling and that all changed.<br> At first, I still sucked at it, but somehow, instead of just feeling discouraged, cycling inspired me to try and be better. This was a new experience for me. I forgot about my lack of talent. I desperately wanted to figure out how to be good at this sport, even if I wasn&#x2019;t the most talented.<br> By the end of the Red Zinger, I was occasionally seeing the front of the race. I&#x2019;d learned during the week that I could get ahead of many of the kids that had more physical strength than I did by being willing to push myself further.<br> The second to last day of the race, there was another time trial, but this time it climbed a big hill. I figured this would be a perfect opportunity to put that theory to the test and see if I could actually push myself to the limit, racing against the clock.<br> I started the time trial off with a snap in my legs and an excitement I had not felt earlier in the week. I wanted to see how good I could be if I just let go of that perfectionistic anchor.<br> It was so liberating to just try to be the best that I could be, without being paralyzed by the &#x201c;what ifs&#x201d; that had held me back until then.<br> &#x201c;What if&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t the best or &#x201c;what if&#x201d; I was embarrassed?<br> So I focused on nothing more than getting the last bit of energy out of my body.<br> After one mile of steep uphill, I already felt I was about to pass out, or to shit in my shorts. My body wasn&#x2019;t used to opening up the throttle, all the way. I had no idea how I was going to continue at such an effort for another three miles, so I focused on the next 50 feet, and then the next 50 feet after that, and so on.<br> Over and over, I dealt with a self-imposed agony that I&#x2019;d never felt before.<br> About halfway, I spotted the rider who had started in front of me. I was about to catch him. Once again, I played games in my head, saying I&#x2019;d push myself as hard as I could until I caught him, and then take a little break.<br> But once I caught him, I was like a kid who&#x2019;d just eaten his first Pringle.<br> I was addicted.<br> I loved catching and passing this innocent victim. I now wanted the whole can&#x2019;s worth. I continued, dead focused on finding more prey before the finish line. And I got my wish.<br> As I entered the last mile, half-animated bodies began to appear on the horizon. I caught them all before the finish.<br> I crossed the line and immediately started retching up whatever was left in my stomach, dry heaving like a cat with a massive hairball. This was something I&#x2019;d never experienced before. It may have sounded terrible but it felt great. I was finally free from not trying. I was free from giving up.<br> Once again, Dad and I waited patiently by the outhouse for them to post the results. Unlike at the start of the week, the crowd wasn&#x2019;t so thick. Most of the kids had gone home, knowing they wouldn&#x2019;t be getting any reward, and feeling a bit tired from the week of racing.<br> But I was wholly invigorated. I was enthralled and just wanted the race to keep going for the rest of summer. Finally, they posted the dot matrix print out on the back of the porta-potty. I was in tenth place, in the ever-important top 10 finishers in a bike race.<br> I&#x2019;d beaten 40 other kids, and wasn&#x2019;t all that far behind the legends of the 12 year olds category.<br> For an odd minute or two, I felt pure elation and pride. Then, as we walked back to the car, I turned to my Dad.<br> &#x201c;Next year, I&#x2019;m going to win this thing,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;You watch, Dad, I&#x2019;m going to win it.&#x201d;<br> From then on, I began plotting how to make an athlete out of a geek&#x2014; a winner out of a loser.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the USA in 1986, there weren&#x2019;t very many mentors or coaches available for kids trying to become bike racers. Colorado had a few folks here and there you could get some advice from, but on the whole, there was no one that was going to take me from a cute loser to a race winner through their brilliant coaching. This would be something I&#x2019;d have to figure out on my own.<br> The one thing I did have a natural talent for was reading. If the topic was interesting to me, I could read for hours and absorb it all like a sponge.<br> Reading had always been an escape for me. It helped me escape from my problems making friends, escape from trouble in school, and escape from the loneliness of being an only child. Of course, most things we were assigned to read in school did not fit the bill of &#x201c;interesting,&#x201d; and therefore I rarely showed much of my reading horsepower actually in school.<br> However, for my newfound project of learning how to train for bike racing, I was ready to read hundreds of thousands of words. I went to the library, and to many bookstores, trying to source the best books on training and cycling in general.<br> The first American Tour de France winner Greg LeMond had come out with a book; the old Polish coach of the 1984 US Olympic team, Eddie Borysewicz, had written a book, a translation of five-time Tour winner Bernard Hinault&#x2019;s book, <i>Memories of the Peloton</i> was now available, and my favorite was Tudor Bompa&#x2019;s <i>Periodisation of Training</i>. But I read anything I could get my hands on.<br> And so there, lying on the couch at my parent&#x2019;s home, I rea...</p><h2>The Florist&#39;s Daughter</h2><p>During the long farewell of her mother&#x2019;s dying, Patricia Hampl revisits her midwestern girlhood.Daughter of a debonair Czech father, whose floral work gave him entr�e to St. Paul society, and a distrustful Irishwoman with an uncanny ability to tell a tale,Hampl remained, primarily and passionately, a daughter well into adulthood. She traces the arc of faithfulness and struggle that comes with that role&#x2014;from the postwar years past the turbulent sixties. At the heart of The Florist&#x2019;s Daughter is the humble passion of people who struggled out of the Depression into a better chance, not only for themselves but for the common good.Widely recognized as one of our most masterly memoirists, Patricia Hampl has written an extraordinary memoir that is her most intimate, yet most universal, work to date.This transporting work will resonate with readers of Francine du Plessix Gray&#x2019;s Them: A Memoir of Parents and JeannetteWall&#x2019;s The Glass Castle.</p><p>PATRICIA HAMPL is the author of four memoirs&#x2014;A Romantic Education, Virgin Time, I Could Tell You Stories, and Blue Arabesque&#x2014;and two collections of poetry. She has received a MacArthur Fellowship, among many other awards. She lives in St. Paul, Minnesota.<i>Starred Review.</i> Hampl (<i>Blue Arabesque</i>; <i>I Could Tell You Stories</i>) begins her very personal memoir with one hand clutching her dying mother Mary's hand, the other composing an obituary on a yellow tablet&#x2014;an apt sendoff for an avid reader of biographies. As years of dutiful caretaking and a lifetime of daughterhood come to an end, Hampl reflects on her middle-class, mid-20th century middle-American stock, the kind of people who assume they're unremarkable... even as they go down in licks of flame. Since her Czech father, Stan, couldn't afford college during the Depression, he made a livelihood as a florist. Hampl's wary Irish mother, a library file clerk, endowed her with the traits of wordiness and archival passion. Like Hampl, Mary was a kind of magic realist&#x2014;a storyteller who, finding people and their actions ancillary, could haunt an empty room with description as if readying it for trouble. The memoir begins with the question of why, in spite of her black-sheep, wanderlust-hippie sensibilities, Hampl never left her hometown of St. Paul, Minn. In the end, the reason is clear. There was work to do, beyond daughterly duty: Nothing is harder to grasp than a relentlessly modest life, she writes. With her enchanting prose and transcendent vision, she is indeed a florist's daughter&#x2014;a purveyor of beauty&#x2014;as well as a careful, tablet-wielding investigator, ever contemplative, measured and patient in her charge. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Shock waves from one Wall Street scandal after another have completely disillusioned us with our banking system; yet we cannot do without banks. Nearly all money today is simply bank credit. Economies run on it, and it is created when banks make loans. The main flaw in the current model is that private profiteers have acquired control of the credit spigots. They can cut off the flow, direct it to their cronies, and manipulate it for personal gain at the expense of the producing economy. The benefits of bank credit can be maintained while eliminating these flaws, through a system of banks operated as public utilities, serving the public interest and returning their profits to the public. This book looks at the public bank alternative, and shows with examples from around the world and through history that it works admirably well, providing the key to sustained high performance for the economy and well-being for the people.</p><p></p><h2>Stout (Classic Beer Style)</h2><p>Michael Lewis, Ph.D., traces the changing view of this popular beer style from a medicinal tonic to its glorified position in today&#39;s beer world.

He hides in&nbsp;a cave, where he meets a mysterious stranger who saves his life. He hides in the village, posing as a deaf-mute peasant boy. He hides among the partisans of the Jewish resistance. But where, he asks, is God hiding? And where can one find redemption in a world that God has abandoned? In a story punctuated by friendship and fear, sacrifice and betrayal, Gregor's wartime wanderings take us deep into the ghost-filled inner world of the survivor.</p><p><b>ELIE WIESEL</b>&nbsp;was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. The author of more than fifty internationally acclaimed works of fiction and nonfiction, he was Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities and University Professor at Boston University for forty years. Wiesel died in 2016.He had no name, so he gave him his own. As a loan, as a gift, what did it matter? In time of war every word is as good as the next. A man possesses only what he gives away.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gregor loved and hated his laugh, which was like no other, which did not even resemble itself.<br>&nbsp;<br>Imagine a life-and-death struggle between two angels, the angel of love and the angel of wrath, the angel of promise and the angel of evil. Imagine that they both attain their ends, each one victorious. Imagine the laugh that would rise above their corpses as if to say, your death has given me birth; I am the soul of your conflict, its fulfillment as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>The laugh of the man who had saved his life.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was a moonless night. It had rained the day before and, because they felt at ease there, the clouds refused to leave the patch of sky above the houses huddled together in the town below. Later Gregor understood why: they were not clouds, properly speaking, but Jews driven from their homes and transformed into clouds. In this disguise they were able to return to their homes where strangers now lived.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was about to fall asleep when he heard an unfamiliar sound in the forest. He jumped from his cot and went to the opening of the cave. Tense, he listened. Was it the clouds? They were making no sound, at least not yet. Then what was it? His eyes, wide open, saw into the darkness. Solitude had taught him to use his senses, to let them guide him, to become an animal, ready to jump, ready to run. He stopped thinking, stopped remembering. He no longer lived outside his body.<br>&nbsp;<br>Where had the sound come from? Now it was gone. A mistake, a false alarm. Back to sleep. A damp wind was whistling among the trees. Nothing more? Nothing more.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nevertheless he remained on the alert. He loved the night, his ally. He loved the clouds which weighed upon the night. In any case he could no longer fall asleep. He cursed the wind for blowing too loudly. War had taught him to curse.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so he waited, listening for the slightest murmur of the woods, where behind every tree he could sense a presence in the night.<br>&nbsp;<br>As a child he had been afraid of the forest, even in daytime. He had been told that it was inhabited by savage wolves that took your life; by bloody creatures that robbed you of your pride; by evil beings sent down to earth to turn men from their way, blinding their vision and draining their passion for life.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now that he was no longer a child, the forest gave Gregor a sense of security. When he stroked the bark of the pine trees he felt close to the earth; when he listened to the rustling leaves he understood that man&#x2019;s secret outlives man. He had learned that the true forest is the one that drives wolves mad and makes men thirst for blood and compassion. There was no use running away from this forest, it is everywhere, separating man from the image of his destiny and from the death of this destiny. Who opened your eyes, Gregor? <i>He </i>did. Did it hurt? Yes and no.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gregor started. Footsteps! He heard them quite clearly. I wasn&#x2019;t dreaming. Someone is there. Someone is looking for me. He glanced at the luminous dial of his watch: ten past two. He knew the time even though he didn&#x2019;t know what day it was. It could have been Friday or Sunday; what did it matter? He was living in a time or war, outside time.<br>&nbsp;<br>How long had he been in the cave? He did not remember. His father promised to come back in three days. Gregor had counted three days, and then three more days. After that he had stopped counting. His father had gone away and taken the numbers with him, forever.<br>&nbsp;<br>The footsteps were drawing closer; the crackling sound was clearer. Gregor&#x2019;s eyes searched the darkness and found nothing. Only anguish. He tried to chase it away, to beguile it, saying over and over to himself: You&#x2019;re not afraid, no, you are not afraid; a boy, seventeen-years-old, isn&#x2019;t afraid of the night or of the unknown. If you are shivering&#x2014;just a little&#x2014;it&#x2019;s because of the cold; if you are stiff, it&#x2019;s because you have no reason to move; if you are holding your breath, it&#x2019;s not for fear of breathing too hard but rather to hear the mysterious sound of night penetrating the forest: two creatures embracing. Sometimes they hurt each other and the earth gives forth a very gentle moan; sometimes they caress, and their song shakes the trees. That is why you are holding your breath, to listen, and also to seize their song and surrender yourself to it. You&#x2019;re not afraid, are you? Gregor isn&#x2019;t afraid of anything, not yet. Gregor is old enough to recognize the exact moment when fear rises, whip in hand, and beats his heart as if to force him to live and to accept himself. Yes, Gregor is also old enough to bar the way, isn&#x2019;t he? I&#x2019;m not afraid; I hate fear; it&#x2019;s degrading. Gregor talked to himself and trembled. Nights are cold in Transylvania, in the spring.<br>&nbsp;<br>The footsteps now seemed very close. Since sounds in the forest are deceiving, Gregor did not know where to place them. Could it be his father? No, impossible. Father would not come back. Never. He was punctuality itself, incapable of making a mistake or of telling a lie. If he had not come, it was because he had changed; he must be in a world where numbers kill, where promises enclose emptiness.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the past Gregor had thought his father was all-powerful and unshakeable, clear-headed in a way that both comforted and terrified those who loved him, those who feared him. They all clung to him, to his words, to his vision. In his presence they felt pure, strong, and invincible. He spoke little, but what he said had the ring and conviction of truth. He used to say, &#x201c;Tomorrow will be a fine day,&#x201d; and the sun obeyed him. He used to say, &#x201c;Whoever walks toward the spring becomes the spring,&#x201d; and so they walked. But then he had also said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back in three days,&#x201d; and he is somewhere else.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gregor remembered his father&#x2019;s last words: under no circumstances open your mouth or otherwise betray your whereabouts. But the waiting and uncertainty were more than he could bear, and he was tempted to disobey: I am going to scream. You didn&#x2019;t keep your promise: why should I keep mine? Time once more existed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d; he said in Hungarian.<br>&nbsp;<br>His voice echoes first in the cave and then in the forest, leaping from tree to tree, from cloud to cloud. And yet he had only whispered.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d; he repeated.<br>&nbsp;<br>Silence. Nothing. Night, clouds, the forest. And his pounding heart. Crouching behind the big tree which concealed the opening of the cave, Gregor held his breath. He did not move, nor did the other. They couldn&#x2019;t see each other. Is he also afraid? Is it his fear that makes me tremble and doubt?<br>&nbsp;<br>The other started walking.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; called out Gregor in panic. &#x201c;Stop there! Don&#x2019;t come closer! I forbid you to take another step.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The other continued to come closer, but Gregor still could not figure out where he was. At times it seemed to him as if the forest were filled with nocturnal hunters, each one of them like the Angel of Death, with a thousand eyes to strangle man&#x2019;s voice and to deform his body. This is my punishment, Gregor thought. I disobeyed my father; I am going to be punished. Words now surged up from his throat, and he could not control them<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Who are you? What do you want? Who sent you here? Whom are you looking for? Where are you going? Who&#x2019;s calling you and who&#x2019;s with you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Carelessly, he stuck his head out of the cave. A thousand thoughts crossed his mind. Was it a policeman making his rounds? A peasant, who would blackmail him? A wanderer? A shepherd out at night? The unknown terrified him. As soon as danger will be there before him, indentified, with a face on it, he would lose his fear and recover his freedom. That&#x2019;s why he cried out again angrily, in German this time: &#x201c;Enough! If it&#x2019;s me you&#x2019;re looking for, come! I&#x2019;m here, I am waiting for you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Then for the first time he heard the laughter. Gregor shuddered and his legs became weak. Behind every tree and within every shred of cloud someone was laughing. It was not the laughter of one man but of a hundred, of seven times seven hundreds.<br>&nbsp;<br>He wanted to stop up his ears: the man wanted to drive him to insanity.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Stop! Stop laughing!&#x201d; he shouted, still in German. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m alone and the war is still raging. It will go on and on, and I shall be more and more alone. Be quiet, will you? Listen to the war and you won&#x2019;t laugh any longer!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>There was a lengthy silence. Suddenly the clouds seemed thicker&#x2014;undoubtedly a transport of Jews coming back from far away to light the fires in their homes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m listening to the war and I&#x2019;m laughing.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Gregor couldn&#x2019;t believe his ears. The voice, which was now very close, had spoken Yiddish. Not Hungarian or German, but Yiddish.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve decided once and for all not to weep,&#x201d; the voice added. &#x201c;To weep is to play their game. I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Now it was Gregor&#x2019;s turn to feel like laughing. Why hadn&#x2019;t he thought of it? It was all so simple. A Jew! A Jew like himself, fleeing from fate; in search of underground shelter, a place in which to hide himself from the piercing stare of death. A Jew who refused to disguise himself as a cloud!</p><h2>Pig the Pug</h2><p>Pig is a greedy and selfish Pug. He has all the bouncy balls, bones, and chew toys a dog could ever want yet he refuses to share with his poor friend, Trevor. Little does he know, however, that being greedy has its consquences. Join Pig as he learns to share - the hard way!.<br>Young readers will love the irresistbly quirky and funny illustrations that are paired with a relatable lesson of learning to share with others. For dog and pet lovers everywhere.</p><p>Aaron Blabey was an actor before he started creating children's books. In 2008, <i>Pearl Barley and Charlie Parsley</i> was awarded Children's Book Council of Australia's Book of the Year. In 2012, <i>The Ghost of Miss Annabel Spoon</i> was named a White Raven by the International Youth Library, Munich, Germany. It also won the Patricia Wrightson Prize in the 2013 New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, and the Children's Peace Literature Award, 2013. And now <i>The Bad Guys</i> has won Australia's Children's Indie Book Award for 2016! Aaron lives with his two children and his wife in Sydney, Australia.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Pig, a greedy little pug, lives with Trevor, an amiable dachshund. While Pig has an assorted array of goodies&#x2014;toy bones, balls, chew toys&#x2014;he refuses to share the wealth with Trevor. When Pig's companion gently attempts to persuade the pug that playing together might be fun, Pig explodes. He jumps on top of a gigantic pile of his loot, jealously guarding it from Trevor&#x2014;and soon finds that pride goes before a (painful) fall. The story is straightforward and fun, though the text, told in rhyming verse, is occasionally strained ("And once he had gathered them/up in a pile,/he howled from the top/with a satisfied smile."). The rich, saturated acrylic artwork has a caricaturelike feel and will invite giggles of delight from readers and listeners. Plump Pig is particularly exaggerated, with bulging eyes, a protruding tongue, and a manic expression as he gestures wildly atop his mountain of toys. Young children will revel in his unapologetically naughty antics and might even learn a lesson or two about the value of sharing. VERDICT Though this tale takes on a familiar subject, it should provoke laughter from the intended audience. A fine option where books on sharing are needed.&#x2014;Mahnaz Dar, School Library Journal</p><h2>Three Saints: Women Who Changed History: Genevieve of Paris, Catherine of Siena, Teresa of Avila</h2><p>Most biographies of women saints tend to be brief summaries extolling their virtues, with a slight mention of their greater contributions to the faith and the world in general.

He lives in New York.1<br> Alice<br> &nbsp;<br> Now that it&#x2019;s fashionable to reveal intimate details of married life, I can state publicly that my wife, Alice, has a weird predilection for limiting our family to three meals a day. I also might as well admit that the most serious threat to our marriage came in 1975, when Alice mentioned my weight just as I was about to sit down to dinner at a New Orleans restaurant named Chez Hel�ne. I hardly need add that Chez Hel�ne is one of my favorite restaurants in New Orleans; we do not have the sort of marriage that could come to grief over ordinary food.<br> &nbsp;<br> Without wanting to be legalistic, I should mention that Alice brought up the weight issue during a long-distance telephone call&#x2014;breaking whatever federal regulations there are against Interstate Appetite Impairment. Like many people who travel a lot on business, I&#x2019;m in the habit of calling home every evening to share the little victories and defeats of the day&#x2014;the triumph, for instance, of happening upon a superior tamale stand in a town I thought had long before been completely carved into spheres of influence by McDonald&#x2019;s and Burger King, or the misery of being escorted by some local booster past the unmistakable aroma of genuine hickory-wood barbecuing into La Maison de la Casa House, whose notion of &#x201c;Continental cuisine&#x201d; seems to have been derived in some arcane way from the Continental-Trailways bus company. Having found myself on business in New Orleans &#x2014;or, as it is sometimes expressed around my office, having found it my business to find business in New Orleans&#x2014;I was about to settle into Chez Hel�ne for a long evening. First, of course, I telephoned Alice in New York. I assumed it would give her great pleasure to hear that her husband was about to have enough sweet potatoes and fried oysters to make him as happy as he could manage to be outside her presence. Scholars of the art have often mentioned Chez Hel�ne as an example of what happens when Creole blends with Soul&#x2014;so that a bowl of greens comes out tasting of spices that the average greens-maker in Georgia or Alabama probably associates with papists or the Devil himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m about to have dinner at Chez Hel�ne,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dr. Seligmann just told me today that you weighed a hundred and eighty pounds when you were in his office last week,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s terrible!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There must be something wrong with this connection,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I could swear I just told you that I was about to have dinner at Chez Hel�ne.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to have to go on a diet. This is serious.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It occurred to me that a man telephoning his wife from a soul-food restaurant could, on the excuse of trying to provide some authentic atmosphere, say something like &#x201c;Watch yo&#x2019; mouth, woman!&#x201d; Instead, I said, &#x201c;I think there might be a better time to talk about this, Alice.&#x201d; Toward the end of the second or third term of the Caroline Kennedy Administration was the sort of time I had in mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, we can talk about it when you get home,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;Have a nice dinner.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I did. It is a measure of my devotion to Alice that I forgave her, even though my second order of fried chicken was ruined by the realization that I had forgotten to tell her I had actually weighed only a hundred and sixty-six pounds. I always allow fourteen pounds for clothes.<br> &nbsp;<br> I must say that Alice tempers her rigidity on the meals-per-day issue by having a broad view of what constitutes an hors d&#x2019;oeuvre. That is not, of course, her only strong point. She is tenacious, for instance&#x2014;having persisted for five or six summers in attempting to wheedle the recipe for the seafood chowder served at Gladee&#x2019;s Canteen, in Hirtle&#x2019;s Beach, Nova Scotia, out of the management. She is imaginative&#x2014;a person who can turn a bucketful of clams into, on successive evenings, steamed clams, clam fritters, clams in white wine sauce, and a sort of clam billi-bi. I can testify to her restraint: on the Christmas I presented her with a Cuisinart food processor, not having realized that what she really wanted was a briefcase, she thanked me politely, the way an exceedingly courteous person might thank a process server for a subpoena. (&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I finally said. &#x201c;I thought it might be good for mulching the Christmas tree.&#x201d;) She is generous&#x2014;the sort of wife who would share even the tiniest order of, say, crawfish bisque with her husband, particularly if he had tears in his eyes when he asked. Alice has a lot of nice qualities, but when someone tells me, as someone often does, how fortunate I am to have her as my wife, I generally say, &#x201c;Yes, she does have a broad view of what constitutes an hors d&#x2019;oeuvre.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I don&#x2019;t mean that her views on this matter are as broad as the views held by our friend Fats Goldberg, the New York pizza baron and reformed blimp, who, in reporting on the semiannual eating binges in Kansas City he still allows himself, often begins sentences with phrases like &#x201c;Then on the way to lunch I stopped at Kresge&#x2019;s for a chili dog.&#x201d; A Kresge chili dog, it seems to me, reflects a view of hors d&#x2019;oeuvres that has strayed from broad to excessive. (It also reflects the fact that Fats Goldberg in binge gear will eat almost anything but green vegetables.) What I mean is that if we happen to be driving through Maine on our way to Nova Scotia, where we live in the summer, Alice does not object when, ten miles from the lobster restaurant where we plan to stop for dinner, I screech to a halt in front of a place that has the look of a spectacular fried-clam stand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll make a nice hors d&#x2019;oeuvre,&#x201d; she says.<br> &nbsp;<br> While I&#x2019;m speaking in Alice&#x2019;s defense, I should also say that I consider her failure with the children half my own: no one person could be responsible for engendering in two innocent little girls a preference for frozen fish sticks over fish. In fact, in Nova Scotia I have seen Alice take a halibut that was on a fishing boat an hour before, sprinkle it ever so slightly with some home-ground flour, fry it for a few seconds until it is covered with a batter whose lightness challenges the batter on a Gladee&#x2019;s fishball, cut it into sticklike slices, and present it to her very own little girls&#x2014;only to have them pick at it for a few minutes and gaze longingly toward the freezer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oddly enough, both of our girls have shown, in quick, maddening flashes, indications of having been born with their taste buds intact. Once, while we were visiting my mother in Kansas City, Abigail, our older daughter, looked up at me during breakfast and said, &#x201c;Daddy, how come in Kansas City the bagels just taste like round bread?&#x201d; Her father&#x2019;s daughter, I allowed myself to hope&#x2014;a connoisseur of bagels before she&#x2019;s five. By age nine she&#x2019;ll probably be able to identify any bialy she eats by borough of origin; she&#x2019;ll pick up some change after school working at Russ &amp; Daughters Appetizer Store as a whitefish taster. On trips to Kansas City, her proud father&#x2019;s &#x201c;hometown, she&#x2019;ll appear as a child prodigy on the stage of the concert hall, lecturing on the varieties of the local barbecue sauce. Not so. At nine, offered anything that does not have the familiarity of white chicken or hamburger or Cheerios, she declines with a &#x201c;No, thank you&#x201d; painful in its elaborate politeness. This is the daughter who, at the age of four, reacted to a particularly satisfying dish of chocolate ice cream by saying, &#x201c;My tongue is smiling.&#x201d; How quickly for parents do the disappointments come.<br> &nbsp;<br> Abigail&#x2019;s younger sister, Sarah, has a palate so unadventurous that she refuses to mix peanut butter with jelly. I have often told her that I hope she chooses a college rather close to home&#x2014;New York University, perhaps, which is in Greenwich Village, just a few blocks from where we live&#x2014;so that when I show up every morning to cut the crusts off her toast I won&#x2019;t require a sleepover. For a couple of years, Sarah refused to enter a Chinese restaurant unless she was carrying a bagel in reserve. &#x201c;Just in case,&#x201d; she often explained. More than once, Alice and Abigail and I, all having forgotten Sarah&#x2019;s special requirements, started to leave for a family dinner in Chinatown only to hear a small, insistent voice cry, &#x201c;My bagel! My bagel!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> One night, in a Chinese restaurant, Sarah became a fancier of roast squab. We were at the Phoenix Gardens, a place in Chinatown that happens to have, in addition to excellent roast squab, a dish called Fried Fresh Milk with Crabmeat, which tastes considerably better than it sounds, and a shrimp dish that is one of the closest New York equivalents to the sort of shrimp served in some Italian restaurants in New Orleans. Just why Sarah would decide to taste roast squab still puzzles historians, since it is known that three months were required for Abigail, perhaps the only human being she completely trusts, to persuade her that chocolate ice cream was really something worth trying. Sarah herself has always treated her passion for a single exotic foodstuff as something that requires no explanation&#x2014;like a mortgage officer who, being sober and cautious and responsible in every other way, sees nothing peculiar about practicing voodoo on alternate Thursdays. During lunch once in Nova Scotia, the subject of favorite foods was brought up by a friend of ours named Shelly Stevens, who is a year or two older than Abigail and is known among gourmets in Queens County mainly for being just about the only person anybody has ever heard of who eats banana peels as well as bananas. Sarah looked up from her peanut-butter sandwich&#x2014;hold the jelly&#x2014;and said, &#x201c;Squab. Yes. Definitely squab.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>My Dirty Dumb Eyes</h2><p><p><b>BEST OF THE YEAR NODS FROM AMAZON, THE WASHINGTON POST, AND USA TODAY'S POP CANDY BLOG!</b></p><p><b>"For years I've encountered Lisa Hanawalt's comics and illustrations piecemeal -- in various magazines and periodicals.

In the third book in the Riverboat Adventure series, 12-year-old Libby Norstad, the daughter of a riverboat captain, plays an exciting role with the Underground Railroad. Cabin boy Caleb Whitney, who has worked with the Underground Railroad, thinks that plans to free the family of Jordan Parker, a runaway slave who is also a cabin boy, are finalized--until Libby, in a moment of anger, reveals to some outsiders that Jordan is a fugitive. Libby deeply regrets her slipup, especially when an escaped convict unsuccessfully tries to capture Jordan. Johnson's description of the rescue is both moving and exciting as the children dodge not only the slave owner but also the vengeful convict. Libby's moral struggle is sometimes didactic and unconvincing, but her character is never passive. Readers are sure to wonder what she'll face in her next adventure. <i>Shelley Townsend-Hudson</i></p><h2>While Shepherds Watch Their Flocks: 40 Daily Reflections on Biblical Leadership</h2><p>The realities and rewards of leadership come to life in this illuminating and insightful look at the ancient biblical image of shepherds.

The best mysteries are the ones whose answers lie in front of us, in plain sight. The best solutions are those moments when all of a sudden we realize what we've known all along. <br><br></p><p>Richard Bach is the author of <i>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</i>, <i>Illusions</i>, <i>One</i>, <i>The Bridge Across Forever</i>, and numerous other books.The hero of Bach's new book, pilot and flight instructor Jamie Forbes, is on a routine run when Maria, the panicked spouse of another pilot, radios that her husband has collapsed at the controls. Forbes talks her through the steps to land safely. Maria's explanation to reporters that Forbes hypnotized her sparks a series of memories for Jamie, and the events that follow force him to examine what constitutes reality, to contemplate what lies beyond the edges of our carefully constructed worlds and whether those edges are real or created by our own limitations. While it mines the same territory as <i>The Secret</i>, Bach's book is far richer, raising provocative questions and striking the perfect balance, providing answers without implying that they are the only&#x2014;or necessarily the right&#x2014;ones. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

M�tro&#x2019;s faster, Ren�.&#x201d;<br><br>She grabbed her leopard-print coat and locked the office door.<br><br>Twenty minutes later she ran up the M�tro steps, perspiring<br>and dodging commuters. Frustrated, she found herself at the<br>exit farthest from where she wanted to be, by the Romanesque<br>church that was now the Mus�e des Arts et M�tiers. Harmonic<br>Gregorian chanting wafted in the cold air and drifted into the<br>enveloping night. Petals of snow lodged like nests of white<br>feathers in the bare-branched trees. What a night, the temperature<br>falling, a storm threatening in the clouded sky. The<br>frigid air sliced her lungs, shot up the mini under her coat.<br><br>Great. She hadn&#x2019;t thought her wardrobe through, as usual.<br>Ren� had better appreciate this. Listen to sense and slow<br>things down.<br><br>She ran across the boulevard into the medieval quartier,<br>still an ungentrified slice of crumbling<i> h�tel particuliers</i>, narrow<br>cobbled streets lined by Chinese wholesale luggage and jewelry<br>shops. Red paper lanterns hanging from storefronts shuddered<br>in the wind. From a half-open door she heard the pebble-like<br>shuffling of mah-jongg tiles.

A warm smile that reached her eyes. &#x201c;Ren� said you&#x2019;d be<br>joining us. We ordered, I hope you don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d; Petite, not<br>much taller than Ren�, she wore jeans and a green sweater as<br>she stood ladling abalone soup into small bowls. &#x201c;Love your<br>coat, Aim�e. Meet my parents.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Bonsoir</i>,&#x201d; Aim�e said politely.<br><br>The unsmiling Monsieur and Madame Wu stared at her.<br>&#x201c;My parents speak Wenzhou dialect,&#x201d; said Meizi with an<br>apologetic shrug. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll translate.&#x201d;<br><br>Aim�e grinned, determined to thaw the atmosphere. Her<br>black-stockinged thigh caught on the plastic-covered seat.<br>Under the disapproving stare of Madame Wu, she remembered<br>Ren�&#x2019;s complaints about how Meizi&#x2019;s parents insisted on chaperoning<br>their dates.<br><br>Ren� set the present on the table beside the steaming soup.<br>&#x201c;Happy birthday, Meizi.&#x201d;<br><br>Aim�e tried not to cringe. Even if it was only earrings, it<br>was too soon. Ren� was nuts, or crazy in love.<br><br>Madame Wu turned and spoke to her husband. Aim�e heard<br>her sharp intonation, and could imagine what was being said.<br><br>But Meizi&#x2019;s face lit up in happiness as she untied the bow<br>and opened the jewelry box. To Aim�e&#x2019;s surprise, it was a ring.<br>A pearl ring, luminous and simple. &#x201c;How thoughtful, Ren�,&#x201d;<br>Meizi gasped. &#x201c;I lost my other ring at the dojo.&#x201d;<br><br>He winked. &#x201c;I hope the next one will sparkle more.&#x201d;<br><br>Meizi blushed.<br><br>Madame Wu pulled the reading glasses down from her<br>short, very black hair&#x2014;dyed, Aim�e could see&#x2014;and shook her<br>head. Round-faced Monsieur Wu, who was much older, averted<br>his gaze.<br><br>Were they criticizing Ren�&#x2019;s gift or objecting to the relationship?<br>Perhaps they didn&#x2019;t want their daughter involved<br>with a dwarf? Despite her own reservations, Aim�e felt a pang<br>for Ren�.<br><br>&#x201c;Lovely, <i>non</i>?&#x201d; Aim�e said, trying to ease the almost palpable<br>tension.<br><br>&#x201c;Try it on, Meizi,&#x201d; Ren� urged.<br><br>Aim�e noticed the look Ren� and Meizi shared. Lost in<br>each other. She nudged Ren�. He ignored her.<br><br>Madame Wu spoke sharply, and Meizi translated. &#x201c;My parents<br>say you&#x2019;re too kind, Ren�.&#x201d;<br><br>Aim�e doubted that. Meizi slipped the ring on her fourth<br>finger. &#x201c;<i>Parfait</i>.&#x201d; Aim�e noticed the bitten nails, the worn<br>calluses on Meizi&#x2019;s fingertips. Meizi set the ring back in the<br>box and passed out the steaming soup bowls. A large serving<br>for Ren�.<br><br>Meizi&#x2019;s phone vibrated on the table. She glanced at the<br>number and pushed her chair back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d;<br><br>Ren�&#x2019;s hand paused on his soupspoon. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you talk later,<br>Meizi?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t take a moment,&#x201d; she said. As Meizi went to the<br>door, Aim�e noticed her backward glance, her beetled brow,<br>before she stepped outside.<br><br>The Wus, not ones for conversation, tucked into the soup.<br>Poor Ren�. Aim�e imagined the dinners he&#x2019;d shared with the<br>humorless Madame and Monsieur Wu. Had she read Meizi, a<br>dutiful daughter, all wrong? A young waitress cleared their<br>bowls, leaving Meizi&#x2019;s, and brought a platter of fragrant roasted<br>duck with shaved scallions.

He flipped his phone open, hit<br>Meizi&#x2019;s number on his speed dial.<br><br>A stooped older woman wearing a stained apron entered<br>the <i>resto</i>. Madame Wu exchanged an uneasy look with Monsieur<br>Wu as the old woman made her way to their table.<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s this, another relative?&#x201d; Aim�e asked.<br><br>&#x201c;The busybody who sells tofu and groceries next to her<br>uncle&#x2019;s place.&#x201d; Ren� frowned. &#x201c;Meizi&#x2019;s not answering her<br>phone.&#x201d;<br><br>Suddenly, the old woman shouted in Chinese.

As if at some mysterious<br>signal, people reached for their coats and fled in a mass<br>exodus.<br><br>Madame and Monsieur Wu stood in unison. Without a<br>word they left the table and were out the door of the <i>resto</i><br>without their coats.

A red glow reflected in the ice veining the cobble<br>cracks. Firemen, an ambulance, the police?<br><br>The young waitress by the door turned down the pop music.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d; Aim�e asked her.<br><br>&#x201c;Trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Trouble as in a robbery?&#x201d; Jewelry stores abounded in the<br>quartier, which had once been the diamond-cutting district.<br><br>&#x201c;The old lady said murder.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Murder?

A terrible feeling hit her. Meizi?<br><br>Ren� had pulled on his coat and was already halfway to the<br>door. Aim�e scooped the jewelry box into her pocket, left a<br>wad of francs on the table, and took off behind him.<br><br>� � �<br><br>Filled with dread, Aim�e hurried down the street,<br>following Ren� past the dimly lit Le Tango, a dance club emitting<br>a reverberating drumbeat. No one stood outside. It was too<br>cold for the usual drunken brawls. A horn blared streets away.<br><br>A flash of red disappeared around the corner. Madame Wu.<br><br>Aim�e glimpsed a few Chinese people crowding the short<br>walkway behind the luggage shop. The dark walkway between<br>the buildings was crowded with garbage bins, wood palettes,<br>old cart wheels, the view ending in a dim red lantern shining<br>on back stairs. Not a hundred yards from the<i> resto</i>. Her shoulders<br>tightened.<br><br>&#x201c;Meizi lives here above the shop.&#x201d; Ren� panted, his breath<br>frosting in the cold. The windows he pointed to were dark.<br>Where were the Wus?<br><br>Aim�e fought a rising panic, picking her way through Chinese<br>people of all ages, mumbling and scraping their feet on<br>the ice.<br><br>&#x201c;Has someone been . . . ?&#x201d; Aim�e&#x2019;s question was interrupted<br>by a woman&#x2019;s piercing scream. People jostled her shoulder as<br>they ran away, their footsteps thudding on the snow. Shivering<br>in the cold and full of misgivings, Aim�e crossed the now<br>deserted walkway.<br><br>Not Meizi, <i>non</i> . . . don&#x2019;t let it be Meizi.<br><br>A rat, fat and brown, its tail the length of its long, wet,<br>furred body, scurried down the steps over the new-fallen snow.<br>It left a trail of red in its wake.<br><br>At the foot of the crumbling stone stairs by Meizi&#x2019;s door, a<br>man&#x2019;s snow-dusted trouser-clad leg sprawled from a wooden<br>palette. She gasped. Bits of gnawed, bloody flesh, orange peels,<br>and black wool threads trailed in the snow. Good God. Her<br>stomach lurched. The rat.<br><br>Aim�e couldn&#x2019;t peel her horrified gaze from the corpse,<br>which was half wrapped in clear plastic, the kind used to secure<br>merchandise to palettes. The man&#x2019;s matted red hair, prominent<br>nose, and cheekbones all melded, smooth and tight, under the<br>clear plastic. Her gaze traveled to his wide, terrified eyes, then<br>to his mouth, frozen open in a snowflake-dusted scream.<br><br>She stumbled and caught herself on the ice-glazed wall.<br>Who was he? He hadn&#x2019;t been here long, judging by the light<br>coating of snow. Where was Meizi?<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Mon Dieu</i>,&#x201d; Ren� said, stepping back. He took a few steps<br>and pounded on Meizi&#x2019;s back door.<br><br>No answer.<br><br>Aim�e gathered up her long leopard-print coat and stepped<br>with care around the dirtied snow, avoiding the overturned<br>garbage bin&#x2019;s contents.<br><br>Her insides churned. She shouldn&#x2019;t have looked at the eyes.<br><br>A pair of black-framed glasses lay in the snow beside his<br>gnawed calf. Crinkled papers, a half-open wallet. Using a dirty<br>plastic bag to cover her hands, she picked the wallet up. No<br>cash or credit cards. Cleaned out.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Aim�e,&#x201d; Ren� said. &#x201c;The <i>flics</i> will handle this.<br>We have to find Meizi.&#x201d;<br><br>Wedged deep in the wallet&#x2019;s fold she found a creased Conservatoire<br>des Arts et M�tiers library card with an address and<br>the name Pascal Samour. The photo showed a younger version<br>of the pale face in plastic before her.<br><br>She turned the card over.<br><br>&#x201c;Put that down, Aim�e,&#x201d; Ren� said.<br><br>Stuck to the other side of the library card by gummy adhesive<br>was a smudged photo of a Chinese girl with a glossy ponytail.<br>Meizi. &#x201c;But look, Ren�.&#x201d;<br><br>He gasped, and his face fell. He stepped back, shaking his<br>head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;<br><br>She caught her breath. &#x201c;He knew Meizi, Ren�. What if<br>she . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You think she&#x2019;s involved?&#x201d; he sputtered. &#x201c;Impossible.&#x201d;<br><br>He punched numbers on his cell phone. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s still not<br>answering. She&#x2019;s in trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment, wide flashlight beams blinded Aim�e. She<br>stumbled, dropped the wallet.

In short, you'll see no body outlaws. <br>The writers in this groundbreaking anthology reveal a world where bodies come in all their many-splendored shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. In doing so, they expand the national dialogue on body image to include race, ethnicity, sexuality, and power&#x2014;issues that, while often overlooked, are intimately linked to how women feel about their bodies. Body Outlaws offers stories by those who have chosen to ignore, subvert, or redefine the dominant beauty standard in order to feel at home in their bodies.<br></p><p>The breezy, irreverent essays in <i>Adios, Barbie</i> are a welcome antidote to the narrow cultural consciousness the tiny doll has fostered for more than 40 years. While thousands of little girls worship Barbie's plasticine perfection, those who wind up dissatisfied with the message she sends--be white, be skinny, be stacked, be pretty, and then you'll be loved--can tell you how a toy skews body image in the real world. Among whites talking trash about blacks and upwardly mobile black folks, notes Erin J. Aubry, big butts are suspect--"low-class and ghettoish," the antithesis of Barbie's tightly tucked derriere. Yet on good days, Aubry applauds her ample proportions, for "unlike hair or skin, the butt is stubborn, immutable--it can't be hot-combed or straightened or bleached into submission. It does not assimilate; it never took a slave name." <p> In "Fishnets, Feather Boas, and Fat," Nomy Lam--a 250-pound, 22-year-old disabled woman--and friends elbow their way to the front of a determinedly different club, "dancing like fiends toward revolution." Lee Damsky tells us why her mother's model of scientific prowess took a dusty third-place to big-screen images of "beauty and femininity [that] seem to offer me absolute power rivaled only by a fascist dictatorship." Because the various writers gathered together here are young, their conceits and world-views are sometimes annoyingly unexamined; by the same token, though, their energy, heckling, and bone-deep assurance make large and pleasing dents in mainstream assumptions. <i>--Francesca Coltrera</i></p>Edut, founder and publisher of the magazine HUES (Hear Us Emerging Sisters), has assembled a collection of the freshest, hippest writers ever to slam Mattel's Barbie doll and speak up for the beauty of the un-blonde, the un-tall and the un-anorexic. Addressing everything you always wanted to know about body image, from leg hair to transsexuals and African American women's posteriors, the more than 25 contributors present a spectrum of attitudes toward the female body. Although a few of the essays are weak when compared to the book's best pieces, the volume as a whole is a step forward in the discussion of how feminine attractiveness is viewed in American society, concluding that women must seek their own definition of beauty in order to gain a sense of self-acceptance. Essays such as Susan Jane Gilman's "Klaus Barbie, and Other Dolls I'd Like to See" and Graciela Rodriguez's "Breaking the Model" provide insight into the challenges of young women who grew up feeling as if they had to compete with the pert and impossibly perfect Barbie. Other pieces, such as "My Jewish Nose" by Lisa Jervis and "My Brown Face" by Mira Jacob, illuminate the obstacles in trying to emulate a Caucasian appearance. Every writer in this splendid collection raises a different issue, yet the essays address the same theme and, cumulatively, make for compelling and important reading. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Raven Prince</h2><p>Widowed Anna Wren is having a wretched day.

Shambaugh Award Winner<br><br> 2015 Spirited Awards Top Ten Finalist</b></p><p>During Prohibition, while Al Capone was rising to worldwide prominence as Public Enemy Number One, the townspeople of rural Templeton, Iowa&#x2014;population just 428&#x2014;were busy with a bootlegging empire of their own. Led by Joe Irlbeck, the whip-smart and gregarious son of a Bavarian immigrant, the outfit of farmers, small merchants, and even the church monsignor worked together to create a whiskey so excellent it was ordered by name: "Templeton rye."</p><p>Just as Al Capone had Eliot Ness, Templeton&#x2019;s bootleggers had as their own enemy a respected Prohibition agent from the adjacent county named Benjamin Franklin Wilson. Wilson was ardent in his fight against alcohol, and he chased Irlbeck for over a decade. But Irlbeck was not Capone, and Templeton would not be ruled by violence like Chicago.</p><p><i>Gentlemen Bootleggers </i>tells a never-before-told tale of ingenuity, bootstrapping, and perseverance in one small town, showcasing a group of immigrants and first-generation Americans who embraced the ideals of self-reliance, dynamism, and democratic justice. It relies on previously classified Prohibition Bureau investigation files, federal court case files, extensive newspaper archive research, and a recently disclosed interview with kingpin Joe Irlbeck. Unlike other Prohibition-era tales of big-city gangsters, it provides an important reminder that bootlegging wasn&#x2019;t only about glory and riches, but could be in the service of a higher goal: producing the best whiskey money could buy.</p></p><p><p></p><p><b>Bryce T.

They were the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games, revving up my enthusiasm for the challenges of the week ahead, or the starting pistol at the horse races, sending me out of the gate with a burst of energy, ready to run the course no matter how much mud was on the track.</p><p>Sadly, those days were over, a fading vision in my rearview mirror, a reminder that life is ever changing&#x2014;and not always for the better. And it wasn&#x2019;t only the beginning of the week that fate had fumbled. It was every morning of every day. Every. Day.</p><p>This morning was a prime example. I&#x2019;d risen at seven o&#x2019;clock, showered, put on mascara, a little blush, skipped the concealer&#x2014;nothing covered my freckles&#x2014;and tamed the red beast that many called my hair. Marco had already walked our rescue dog, Seedy, and brought me a cup of coffee laced with half-and-half, just the way I liked it.

So we&#x2019;d decided to build. Because of <i>that</i> decision, we needed to save money and find a temporary place to live, so&#x2014;<i>deep breath, Abby</i>&#x2014;we&#x2019;d moved in with my parents.</p><p>To be honest, I wasn&#x2019;t in favor of it, but they&#x2019;d insisted, and Marco had accepted for both of us, something I believed he had come to regret. In any case, we were now ensconced in my childhood bedroom, still painted screaming yellow with purple accents and decorated with plaster of paris handprints I made in kindergarten, a silhouette of my ten-year-old head, framed awards for perfect attendance (the only awards I&#x2019;d ever received), and posters of my favorite childhood movies. Basically, I was living in a flashback.</p><p>Now the room that had once been my punishment&#x2014;as in, &#x201c;Go to your room, young lady&#x2014;you are grounded!&#x201d;&#x2014;had become my sanctuary. It was the only place in the house where Marco and I had any privacy, and even then, we had our little Seedy packed in with us.</p><p>In my parents&#x2019; kitchen, which was spacious enough for a long, farm-style table and eight chairs, Marco made oatmeal for himself and I had a second cup of coffee. I never ate at home on Mondays because my assistant, Lottie, always served up her famous skillet breakfast at Bloomers that day. We were joined in short order by my mom, Maureen &#x201c;Mad Mo&#x201d; Knight, a kindergarten teacher and weekend artist who managed her household with the same firm hand with which she ran her classroom.</p><p>This morning, Mom had made a new dish involving eggs, tomatoes, something, and something for herself and Dad, and now she insisted I eat it. I told her up front I didn&#x2019;t want any, and she knew very well why. Even so, a battle of wills ensued, with my mother maintaining that I was not getting out of the house without trying her omelet. The stalemate was broken by my dad, who had rolled his wheelchair into the kitchen to eat breakfast and instead found himself initiating what amounted to hostage negotiations, one of Dad&#x2019;s areas of expertise.</p><p>&#x201c;Take a seat, Maureen,&#x201d; he began, scooting out a chair for her. &#x201c;Right here, across from your daughter.&#x201d;</p><p>My father, Sergeant Jeffrey Knight, had been a cop for twenty years before a drug dealer&#x2019;s bullet blew a hole through his leg and landed him in the hospital. Then surgery to remove the bullet caused a partial paralysis of his legs that confined him mostly to the wheelchair. He&#x2019;d retired from the force soon after, but he would always and forever be a cop. Thus the negotiations.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, Mo,&#x201d; Dad said, one hand on her shoulder, &#x201c;you know Abracadabra has breakfast at Bloomers on Mondays, right?&#x201d;</p><p>This got a reluctant yes from my mother. I suspected he had used my childhood nickname to remind Mom of the adorable cherub I had once been. I think she and I would have agreed that was a debatable point.</p><p>&#x201c;And, Ab, you know that all you have to do is eat a few forkfuls to make Mom happy, right?&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged, indicating ambivalence. Bad move on my part. Dad was looking for total capitulation.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, Abby,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You know your mother is only acting in your best interests.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Dad, I know that.&#x201d; I glanced at Marco, seated across the table from me, and rolled my eyes. He shook his head as though to say, <i>Nope. I&#x2019;m out of it.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Now, who is willing to compromise here so we can move on to a pleasant topic of conversation?&#x201d; Dad asked.</p><p>Not me. I wasn&#x2019;t about to give in. That was just what Mom wanted.</p><p>Wait, what had I just said? A shiver raced up my spine. <i>Dear God, it&#x2019;s like I never moved away from home.</i> It was as though the years after high school graduation, through college, through my failed attempt at law school, through two years of owning Bloomers, had vanished once I&#x2019;d stepped back into my old bedroom.</p><p>I had to get that new house built fast.</p><p>&#x201c;This is my last word on the subject, Abigail,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;A little protein will make you feel better until you can have breakfast at Bloomers. You know how you crash and burn when you&#x2019;re overly hungry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; I said, then sipped my coffee. Marco finished his oatmeal silently, his gaze seeking out the clock on the wall.</p><p>At that point Dad began his new ritual wherein he read aloud articles from the morning newspaper.</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s something for you, Abracadabra,&#x201d; he said, and began reading. I rolled my eyes at Marco again and pulled out my cell phone, ostensibly to check messages but actually to play a game so I could tune Dad out.</p><p>My phone rang in the middle of my losing the game, so I paused to check the screen and noticed that Mom and Dad were both waiting to hear who my caller was.</p><p>&#x201c;Just Jillian,&#x201d; I said, then left the room to take the call. My cousin Jillian was the unbearably proud mother of a one-month-old baby girl named Harper Abigail Lynne Osborne, whose initials by no coincidence spelled <i>HALO</i>. The child was Jillian&#x2019;s little angel and even had a &#x201c;halo&#x201d; of white seed pearls that Jillian put on her tiny head like a sweatband every time a photo op presented itself.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t very well complain, however, since Jillian had chosen Harper&#x2019;s middle name as a tribute to me, the loyal cousin who&#x2019;d stuck by crazy Jillian through thick and thin. And while I appreciated her having a healthy, adorable baby, it seemed a little too early in the game to declare presidential aspirations for Harper.</p><p>&#x201c;Abs, you won&#x2019;t believe what Harper did,&#x201d; Jillian said.</p><p>This was her daily mantra, and I was tired of it. &#x201c;Let me guess. She woke up, nursed, pooped, and went back to sleep.&#x201d;</p><p>Seriously, what else did month-old babies do? I tuned Jillian out, too.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Marco and I broke free and headed for the town square in my refurbished banana yellow 1960 Corvette. I&#x2019;d gotten the car for a steal after it had been found languishing in a barn under a huge collection of junk. When the farmer who owned the property died, the family had wanted to get rid of everything, making the sporty little car totally affordable for an impoverished law school flunk-out. The poor &#x2019;Vette had been horribly mistreated, but a good paint job had fixed most of that.</p><p>Had it been my choice, I would have been the one driving, something I loved passionately. But Marco always got behind the wheel first, so I had to let it go because I loved him <i>more</i> passionately. I also would have cranked up the volume on the radio and sung along, ragtop down, wind blowing my hair, feeling as free as a cloud in the sky, but I felt self-conscious with Marco there.</p><p>I decided to stay mum about it, however, since his green Prius had been totaled just a month earlier while he was trying to save me from a killer. He hadn&#x2019;t bought another vehicle yet because he was certain we could save money by carpooling.</p><p>He parked in a public lot a block off the square and we walked to Franklin Street, where both of us had businesses. Seedy hobbled happily along with us, pausing as we stopped midway between our shops for a kiss.</p><p>&#x201c;Dinner at the bar after work?&#x201d; Marco asked, brushing a strand of hair off my face.</p><p>&#x201c;You bet. And maybe we should start having breakfast out, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your parents aren&#x2019;t that bad, Sunshine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Marco, do you really like having someone read the paper to you? Or insist you eat their food when you&#x2019;re not even hungry?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re always hungry when you wake up. And we&#x2019;re not going to live with them forever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It just feels that way,&#x201d; I said with an exasperated sigh.</p><p>Marco looked deep into my eyes. &#x201c;Be grateful you have them.&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t argue. Marco&#x2019;s father had died when he was a teenager, and he still felt the loss. Besides, I was starving and just wanted to get to Bloomers so I could eat. I kissed him again, then headed down the block while he headed up.</p><p>Franklin was one of four streets that made up New Chapel&#x2019;s courthouse square. The five-story white limestone county seat was situated in the middle of a large expanse of green lawn, with cement planters at all four corners and cedar benches placed along the sidewalks. The courthouse was the heart of the town, making it a bustling place.</p><p>Normally at that time of the morning not much was happening, however, as most shops wouldn&#x2019;t open for another hour and the courthouse staff wouldn&#x2019;t roll in until eight thirty. But something was about to happen this morning, and by the looks of it, I was guessing a press conference. Workers were setting up microphones at the top of the wide courthouse steps, hanging banners from the portico, and cordoning off an area with thick burgundy ropes for whatever VIPs were going to be there.</p><p>Other than the workers and a few men in dark suits huddled near the mics, the only other person out that early was Jingles, the old window washer, who was squeegeeing off the windows of the business next to mine.</p><p>Jingles, so named for the coins in his pocket that he rattled when he talked, had been washing windows for as long as I&#x2019;d been coming down to the square. With his old tin pail and trusty squeegee, his worn jeans, gray sweatshirt jacket, and scuffed black work boots, the seventy-five-year-old senior was as much a fixture as the courthouse.</p><p>But as we approached Bloomers, Seedy saw Jingles and scurried behind me, causing the leash to wind around my ankles, nearly bringing me down. Her reaction wasn&#x2019;t unusual. The abuse she&#x2019;d suffered from her previous owner had left her with a fear of most people, especially men.</p><p>&#x201c;Seedy, stop. Hold still.&#x201d; As I untangled my legs, my phone beeped, so before I scooped her up I pulled out my cell and saw a text from Jillian: <i>Call me.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Not going to happen,&#x201d; I muttered, then nearly stepped into a bucket of sudsy water that Jingles had set on the sidewalk.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, Jingles,&#x201d; I called as my thumbs flew over the buttons on my phone: <i>Busy now. Maybe later.</i> With a huff of annoyance, I dropped the phone into my purse and picked up my dog. I had no time for Jillian&#x2019;s nonsense.</p><p>I opened the yellow frame door and stepped inside the loveliest shop on the square. Did it matter that I had mortgaged Bloomers to the hilt? <i>My</i> name, not the bank&#x2019;s, was on the sign above the door. But just to be certain bank gremlins hadn&#x2019;t repossessed it overnight, I put Seedy down, then peeked through the glass pane for a quick look up.</p><p>BLOOMERS FLOWER SHOP</p><p>Abby Knight, Proprietor</p><p>Oops. I had to remember to order a sign with my new name on it.</p><p>&#x201c;Morning, love,&#x201d; Grace called, coming out of the coffee-and-tea parlor, a charming Victorian-themed caf� I&#x2019;d added to lure more people into Bloomers. Grace Bingham, an elegant sixtysomething expat from Great Britain, not only ran the parlor, but also baked fresh scones daily and made the best gourmet coffee in town. &#x201c;Shall I pour your coffee now or wait until Lottie calls us to the kitchen for breakfast?&#x201d;</p><p>I crouched down to detach the leash from Seedy&#x2019;s collar. &#x201c;Now, please.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You did remember to buy the eggs, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Was I supposed to buy eggs?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lottie mentioned we were out last Friday, and you said you&#x2019;d take care of it.&#x201d;</p><p>I really needed to start paying more attention when people were talking to me. Make that <i>certain</i> people.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll run to the grocery store right now.&#x201d; I let Seedy off her leash, and she hobbled to the big bay window and jumped up&#x2014;an amazing feat for a three-legged dog. She loved to watch the comings and goings on the courthouse square across the street.</p><p>&#x201c;There won&#x2019;t be enough time for a grocery run, dear,&#x201d; Grace said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got an appointment at eight forty-five&#x2014;another wedding consultation. And we have flower orders for two funerals today, so it&#x2019;s all hands on deck. We&#x2019;ll have to skip breakfast today.&#x201d;</p><p>A wave of nausea rolled through my empty stomach. Skipping breakfast was not an option. My body required two things to operate efficiently: regular meals and seven hours of sleep. Deprived of either or both, Abigail Christine Knight Salvare turned into an actual redheaded beast.</p><p>At once, my mom&#x2019;s words resounded in my head: <i>You know how you crash and burn when you&#x2019;re hungry.</i></p><p>Well, I would just prove her wrong. There would be no crashing or burning.</p><p>&#x201c;The Old World Deli has breakfast sandwiches,&#x201d; I said, pulling out my cell phone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll order egg and sausages for all of us, then dash over and pick them up.&#x201d;</p><p>That was one of the benefits of working on the town square. Everything one needed was only five minutes away.</p><p>While I was on the phone, Seedy began to whine and paw the window. Then she jumped down and hobbled to the front door, putting her paw on it and looking over at me.</p><p>&#x201c;It appears you&#x2019;ll have company on your walk to the deli,&#x201d; Grace said.</p><p>I snapped Seedy&#x2019;s leash on, picked her up, and headed back outside. As soon as we&#x2019;d crossed Franklin Street, I set her down agai...</p></p><h2>The Book of 1st Corinthians Study Guide</h2><p><p>Featuring weekly video teachings with Jennie Allen from RightNow Media.

McIver, Seminary Studies (Robert K. McIver <i>Seminary Studies 37</i>)</p><h2>Christian Human Rights (Intellectual History of the Modern Age)</h2><p><p>In <i>Christian Human Rights</i>, Samuel Moyn asserts that the rise of human rights after World War II was prefigured and inspired by a defense of the dignity of the human person that first arose in Christian churches and religious thought in the years just prior to the outbreak of the war. The Roman Catholic Church and transatlantic Protestant circles dominated the public discussion of the new principles in what became the last European golden age for the Christian faith. At the same time, West European governments after World War II, particularly in the ascendant Christian Democratic parties, became more tolerant of public expressions of religious piety. Human rights rose to public prominence in the space opened up by these dual developments of the early Cold War.</p><p>Moyn argues that human dignity became central to Christian political discourse as early as 1937. Pius XII's wartime Christmas addresses announced the basic idea of universal human rights as a principle of world, and not merely state, order. By focusing on the 1930s and 1940s, Moyn demonstrates how the language of human rights was separated from the secular heritage of the French Revolution and put to use by postwar democracies governed by Christian parties, which reinvented them to impose moral constraints on individuals, support conservative family structures, and preserve existing social hierarchies. The book ends with a provocative chapter that traces contemporary European struggles to assimilate Muslim immigrants to the continent's legacy of Christian human rights.</p></p><p>Samuel Moyn is Professor of Law and History at Harvard University and author of The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History. He is coeditor, with Jan Eckel, of The Breakthrough: Human Rights in the 1970s, also available from University of Pennsylvania Press.<p>Introduction</p><p>Christmas Day, 1942. The outcome of World War II was undecided. A month before, the tide at Stalingrad had turned against the Germans; just two days before, General Erich von Manstein had abandoned his efforts to relieve the Wehrmacht's doomed Sixth Army. Still, there was no telling that the extraordinary German strength in the war on display so far would now ebb quickly. Nonetheless, the Roman Catholic pope, Pius XII, had something new to say.</p><p>The Americans had formally entered the war a year before, but the Allies would not reach mainland Italy for another nine months, or make it to Rome for a year and a half. The pope felt himself in dire straits. His relationship with Benito Mussolini had long since soured, and he was a prisoner in his own tiny Roman domain. As for the Jews, the worst victims of the conflict, millions were dead already; the victims at Babi Yar had lain in their ravine for more than a year; Treblinka, the most infernal death camp, had begun killing operations six months before and much of its grim work was already complete.</p><p>Officially, of course, the papacy and its leader were neutral in the war, and did not play politics. Many of Pius's flock, however, were to be found on all sides of the war. To the extent recent observers have revisited Pius's Christmas message, it has been to argue about whether he could or should have said more about the Holocaust than he did. But the real interest in the message is what the pontiff was for, not what he was against. In this fight, Christianity stood for values, and in the perspective of world history, Pius XII had some new ones.</p><p>On that day, the appeal to reaffirm faith in the dignity of the human person, and in the rights that follow from that dignity, reached unprecedented heights of public visibility. The very first of the five peace points that Pius XII offered that day ran as follows:</p><blockquote><i>Dignity of the Human Person</i>. He who would have the Star of Peace shine out and stand over society should cooperate, for his part, in giving back to the human person the dignity given to it by God from the very beginning . . . <i>He should uphold respect for and the practical realization of . . . fundamental personal rights</i> . . . The cure of this situation becomes feasible when we awaken again the consciousness of a juridical order resting on the supreme dominion of God, and safeguarded from all human whims; a consciousness of an order which stretches forth its arm, in protection or punishment, over <i>the unforgettable rights of man</i> and protects them against the attacks of every human power.</blockquote>It was a critical turning point, one that defines history since, if not exactly in ways that Pius XII intended.<p></p><p>People now treat such affirmations, and especially the notion that human dignity provides the foundation for universal human rights, as a set of conventional and enduring truths. Yet it was all rather new at the time. The Roman Catholic Church had previously rejected the hitherto secular and liberal language of human rights. But now the pope turned to it, making human dignity its new basis. Around the same time, ecumenical formations of transatlantic Protestant elites proclaimed human rights to be the key to future world order. The communion between human rights and Christianity was therefore a novel and fateful departure in the history of political discourse.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the pope's first peace point was the supreme, influential, and most publicly prominent invocation of human dignity during World War II proper and likely in the whole history of political claim-making to that date. It gave Christian "personalism" a broad hearing, attaching supreme ethical significance to human beings agonizingly caught between individualist atomism without community and "totalitarian" statehood without freedom. Alongside novel Protestant discussion, it was also at or near the top of the list of prominent wartime invocations of the basic idea of universal human rights, especially when understood as a framework&#x2014;as Pius XII would express it very clearly two years later in his 1944 Christmas message&#x2014;of world and not merely state order. But what did such conceptions mean as they made their way into, and did much to define, democratic and international ideals after the war?</p><p>The history of human rights in the 1940s was hardly just a matter of Christians merely adopting longstanding rhetoric or even commitments, in spite of the long prior history of rights in various forms and settings. Amplifying the importance of human rights before a vast public, Pius's statement also recrafted the meaning of the principles it merely claimed to recall to importance. It made what had been secular and liberal into a set of values that were now religious and conservative. And it provided an inkling of how Christians would come to defend the postwar democracies they later founded in Western Europe, which were religious and conservative in nature. This book tells the story of how this happened.</p><p>***</p><p>The ideological association of Christianity and human rights depended on contingent and timebound circumstance no later than the 1940s and shortly before. Far from teaching us simply about the Christian invention of human rights in the 1940s, interesting and important as that development was, the history of this crystallizing moment casts light on the fortunes of the concept as a whole. Not the least of the reasons is that it turns out to be quite difficult to find non-Christians who enthused about human rights, and more especially their basis in human dignity, in the age. The history of Christian human rights in the 1940s is the major part of the history of human rights generally at the time, before the principles became the slogan of a mass movements and a central element of contemporary international law.</p><p>Mainstream observers are generally unaware of&#x2014;for their secular historians have nervously bypassed&#x2014;the Christian incarnation of human rights, which interferes with their preferred understandings of today's highest principles. Meanwhile, those interested in Christian sources, overwhelmingly Christians themselves, are prone to misinterpret them. The proposition that human rights arose with profound connections to Christian contexts is normally defended, in both public discourse and scholarly arguments, in a highly abstract way and about long ago events. It was from "the biblical conception of man," Pope John Paul II noted in 2003, that "Europe drew the best of its humanistic culture, and, not least, advanced the dignity of the person as the subject of inalienable rights." Preference for classic sources that supposedly cast the die for Christianity's advocacy of human rights across the millennia is especially evident among certain Christians who most want to take credit for what have become the premier values of the day, precisely in view of their contemporary prestige. According to such views, it is rather old Christian lineages&#x2014;stretching from the Annunciation to the Reformation&#x2014;that help explain the existence, shape, and prestige of the idea of human rights today.</p><p>Looking back that far is not a mere distraction. No one could plausibly claim&#x2014;and no one ever has&#x2014;that the history of human rights is one of wholly discontinuous novelty, whether in the 1940s or after. But radical departures nonetheless occurred very late in Christian history, even if they were unfailingly represented as consistent with what came before: this is how "the invention of tradition" most frequently works. Christian human rights were injected into tradition by pretending they had always been there, and on the basis of minor antecedents now treated as fonts of enduring commitments. Novelty always comes about not <i>ex nihilo</i> but from a fragmentary past that is coaxed into more robust form. Even partial continuity across time often proceeds through rediscovery and reactivation of lost possibilities and underemphasized realities. Many of those who want the ideological association of Christianity and human rights to be deep and lasting are participants in such inventions rather than analysts of them, for they play down or pass over the fact that Christianity had mostly stood for values inimical to those we now associate with human rights. It took a set of wrenching experiences for Christianity to come to seem favorable to them. This book tries to understand how large an impact those experiences made&#x2014;and how much continuity they left behind.</p><p>The truth is that Europe and therefore the modern world drew nearly everything from Christianity in the long term. It would be fictitious to retrospectively edit the long and tumultuous history of Europe, as if everything we liked about the outcomes were due to its hegemonic religion, while the rest was an unfortunate accident or someone else's fault. And to the extent this is true, the challenge of isolating the crucial period for a strong ideological link of Christianity with human rights changes. It means looking not so much at Jesus (or even at the Reformation), but at novel mid-twentieth century interpretations of what his teachings demand, to understand how the huge set of possibilities the Christian legacy bequeathed was winnowed down.</p><p>The trouble, after all, is not so much that Christianity accounts for nothing, as that it accounts for everything. Without Christianity, our commitment to the moral equality of human beings is unlikely to have come about, but by itself this had no bearing on most forms of political equality&#x2014;whether between Christians and Jews, whites and blacks, civilized and savage, or men and women. That had been true for millennia, and it was mostly still true on Christmas Day, 1942. If the winnowing of Christian values was not complete (and never is, since traditions are never set), it was above all because the war was undecided. Pius's peace points are fascinating because they introduce human dignity and rights before the war's outcome was clear.</p><p>It was not just that over its long trajectory, Christianity had stood for the star of peace, but also the dogs of war, when their violence was thought to serve justice; that its members had powered abolitionism in the nineteenth century, but also that slavery's defenders relied upon Christianity's long tolerance and support for the institution; that Christians stood for the spiritual kingdom, but also had served worldly empires, from Rome to modern global ones; and that, whatever the fervency of their commitment to the equality of souls, patriarchy in so many forms was perhaps their fundamental commitment. Most relevant to our purposes, Christians and Christian thought were deeply entangled in the collapse of liberal democracy on the European continent between the wars. Catholicism in particular had celebrated victories for its social teachings in the fall of liberal democracy in authoritarian Austria, Spain, and Portugal in the 1930s, and Vichy France during the war, even as a Catholic priest was the titular head of Nazi Germany's most subservient client state, Slovakia. Christians even had truck with fascism. From the pinnacle of the churches to the rank and file, only a few Christians denounced it in these years, and normally then in the name of strictly Christian ideals and interests; more acquiesced to fascism, or fervently served it, including in Nazi Germany, what some were calling "the holy reich."</p><p>And yet it is also Christians who did much and perhaps most to welcome and define the idea human rights in the 1940s, and some of its core notions such as the importance of human dignity, which nobody else was yet making central in 1942. How was this possible? Perhaps it was because, to a rather disturbing extent, human rights and especially human dignity had no necessary correlation with liberal democracy. Certainly not in 1942, when Christian leaders such as the pope were not yet (to the extent he ever became) friendly towards that regime. It would be tempting to argue that its flirtation with far-right politics and the horror of totalitarianism summoned Christianity back to its true essence, but this argument only works so long as it is recalled that the fundamental truths its partisans wanted most to honor were morally constraining, and that human rights entered the equation as a belated discovery about how to achieve enduring ends. And so when liberal democracy later came in Western Europe, it was in a conservative and religious form graced by a commitment to human dignity that signaled enormous continuity with the past, not simply learning from mistakes.</p><p>***</p><p>Almost unfailingly, the annunciation of human rights in the 1940s is now viewed by the general public and professional scholars as the uncomplicated triumph of liberal democracy. But the general thesis of <i>Christian Human Rights</i> is that through this lost and misremembered transwar era, it is equally if not more viable to regard human rights as a project of the Christian right, not the secular left. Their creation brought about a break with the revolutionary tradition and its <i>droits de l'homme</i>, or&#x2014;better put&#x2014;a successful capture of that language by forces reformulating their conservatism.</p><p>For this reason, the central question about Christian human rights in the 1940s is whether the Christian and conservative encounter with human rights&#x2014;the embrace of liberal principle by forces once inimical to it&#x2014;is plausibly seen as a victory for liberalism. Conservatism, to be sure, was updated through affiliation with historically liberal norms and a historically liberal language. Authoritarian solutions to crisis were taken off the table&#x2014;with the very large exception of the Iberian peninsula, where they survived for several more decades. But in reviewing this process it behooves one to ask whether Christianity and conservatism were able to change liberalism more than they were changed by it. In this period, perhaps the most durable and fateful transformation was the start of a new era in liberalism&#x2014;specifically, the ideological origins of religiously-inflected Cold War liberalism in the face of the specter of "totalitarianism." It was a new liberalism that substantially overlapped with conservatism, suitably corrected, after the purgation of the extreme right and for the sake of standing down the left, extreme and not so extreme. In many respects, that conservative vision of liberalism remains alive and well.</p><p>This book on the origins of Christian human rights therefore focuses most of all on the extent to which, across the 1930s and 1940s, the language of rights was extricated from the legacy of the French Revolution, the secularist mantle which the Soviet leaders were now widely seen to have assumed. And thanks to their championship within a new political formation&#x2014;constitutionally organized religious democracy governed by Christian parties&#x2014;a compromise between Christianity and democracy became not only palatable, but a precious resource for the future of religious values.</p><p>In the nineteenth century, what Pius XII in 1942 called the "unforgettable rights of man" were precepts that his predecessors had tried very hard to forget, because their success or failure was very closely correlated with the success or failure of secular liberalism in the wake of the French Revolution (though the latter's own Declarati...</p></p><h2>The Heart Revolution: The Extraordinary Discovery That Finally Laid the Cholesterol Myth to Rest</h2><p><blockquote>A safe, effective, and revolutionary program for lowering homocysteine levels and cutting your risk of heart disease</blockquote><p>In this groundbreaking book, Dr. Kilmer S.

Couples wishing to resist such pressure see elopement or a slapdash wedding as the only alternatives to a gaudy blowout. But none of these choices appealed to a bride who happened to have been brought up by Miss Manners. Judith Martin and her newlywed daughter, Jacobina, explain how to have a dignified ceremony and delightful celebration without succumbing to the now-prevalent pattern of the vulgar, money-draining wedding that exhausts families and exploits friends. 6 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Jacobina Martin</strong> teaches improvisational comedy at Chicago&#x2019;s Second City and just married Ronald Kroll.</p><p><strong>Judith Martin</strong>, born a perfect lady in an imperfect society, is the author of the &#x201c;Miss Manners&#x201d; columns and best-selling books, two novels, and a travel book on Venice.

Every conceivable subject gets its space, including the absolutely right (and wrong) proposal, avoiding the &#x201c;bridezilla&#x201d; factor, coping with invitations, chief responsibilities of the parties in the wedding, and the three terrible ideas: weddings as (choose one) &#x201c;my day,&#x201d; fund-raiser, or show biz. A question-and-answer format usually follows each major block of content; it&#x2019;s here where the authors let loose their humor.

Each struggles to reconcile her Arab identity with her American one.

She is also a Lecturer in the Johns Hopkins University&#x2019;s MA in Writing program.Darraj, who edited <i>Scheherazade's Legacy: Arab and Arab American Women on Writing</i>, makes a capable debut with this collection that follows Palestinian-American �migr� families in South Philadelphia. Darraj succeeds admirably in suggesting the diversity of Palestinian-Americans: the four friends Nadia, Aliyah, Hanan and Reema each comes from a family with its own story of exile. Nadia's mother, a doctor's daughter, discovers in "The New World" that the mysterious "tall, slim blonde woman" whom she nicknames "Homewrecker Barbie" was her husband's former green-card wife. Aliya spends "An Afternoon in Jerusalem" at the Dome of the Rock where a hijab-wearing woman, noticing her crucifix, welcomes her in and shows her how to wrap her hair. After suffering the patronizing attitudes of her husband John's parents and graduate school colleagues, Hanan makes "The Journey Home," reconciling with her parents and practicing her mother's craft, basket making, with commercial success. In "The Scent of Oranges," Reema's mother retells her refugee camp experience, specifically for her daughter. Darraj's first-person narrators are not distinct, and her vignette-like stories remain at the edge of plot. There's a passionate sense here of inheritance as a two-way street that transforms immigrants and their children, but Darraj doesn't quite connect the dots. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Peter Hook has written a no-holds-barred, comprehensive account of the band&#39;s entire history, packed with outrageous anecdotes and including every set list and tour itinerary and interspersed with &#39;geek facts&#39; of every piece of electronic equipment used to forge the sound that changed the direction of popular music.</p><p><p>&#x201c;If Joy Division defined my life, New Order shaped it&#x201d;: a fascinating story of sex, drugs, and (indie) rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll; of art, money, and crass stupidity; of blind faith and amazing good luck&#x2014;backed by a soundtrack of truly great songs written by wonderful musicians</p><p>In May 1980 with two acclaimed albums Joy Division had the world at their feet. Then on the eve of their ?rst American tour everything changed. The band&#x2019;s troubled lead singer, Ian Curtis, committed suicide. As Peter Hook has written, &#x201c;One day we were Joy Division, then our lead singer died, and the next time we got together, we were a new band.&#x201d; </p><p>That new band was New Order&#x2014;their label Factory Records, their club The Ha�ienda&#x2014;all based in Manchester, England. Their distinctive sound, a fusion of post-punk and groundbreaking electronica, paved the way for the Indie/dance music explosion that followed. This innovation would earn them the reputation as one of the most influential groups of their generation, changing the course of popular music on both sides of the Atlantic. Despite their success, New Order were always a collision of the visionary and the volatile, forged in the maverick atmosphere of their hometown, an atmosphere of creativity, epic drug use, and boundary-pushing music. More often than not, relationships in the band were fraught with tension, and New Order broke up and reformed with a frequency that kept fans, and the music press, watching their every move. </p><p>The third book in his trilogy, which started with the highly regarded <em>The Ha�ienda: How Not to Run a Club</em> and the bestselling <em>Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division,</em> <em>Substance: Inside New Order</em> is a no-holds-barred account of New Order&#x2019;s entire twenty-seven-year history. Containing outrageous anecdotes, tales of mad excess and astonishing creative perseverance, this book is packed with rich detail, complete discographies, and fascinating technical information about how the music was made. It is also a rollicking read, sure to impress with Hook&#x2019;s talent for recalling the most minute and intimate detail and spinning epic yarns.</p>Peter Hook was born in 1956 in Salford. He was a founding member of Joy Division and New Order and DJs internationally as well as touring Joy Division&#39;s music with his new band The Light. He lives in Cheshire.</p><h2>The Leadership Crisis and the Free Market Cure: Why the Future of Business Depends on the Return to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness</h2><p><p><b>A FREE MARKET APPROACH TO LEADERSHIP.<br> A BOLD VISION FOR AMERICAN BUSINESSES.</b></p> <p>Hailed by <i>Forbes</i> magazine as &#x201c;one of the most important books of the year,&#x201d; John Allison&#x2019;s breakout bestseller <i>The Financial Crisis and the Free Market Cure</i> came as a much-needed wake-up call at a time when capitalism itself was under fire.

This picture book biography is now back in print with a new author's note and beautiful new illustrations. Ms. Walker lives in Northern California.</p>"Though War is Old / It has not / Become wise," Walker writes in&nbsp;this spare, eloquent poem. Naive-style&nbsp;paintings in neon-bright colors celebrate&nbsp;forest diversity&nbsp;and&nbsp;urban communities&nbsp;across the globe. Then each community, in turn, is destroyed by war, its glowing warmth&nbsp;disappearing beneath clouds of smoke and ash. On the first page, a smiling frog and a beautiful pink flower bask in a pond; on the opposite page, "Huge tires / Of a / Camouflaged / Vehicle are /About to / Squash / Them flat."&nbsp;Then the destruction intensifies: something drops from the sky on a Latino boy dreaming on a haystack. Images of eyes greedy for oil give way to a stark picture of mothers and babies&nbsp;buried beneath swirling,&nbsp;tactile streams of waste.&nbsp;The communities are always idyllic, with no&nbsp;hint of poverty or struggle, but&nbsp;the&nbsp;activist message&nbsp;and&nbsp;sometimes frightening images will&nbsp;compel children to talk about what they feel and see.

Rochman, Hazel</p><h2>Uppity: My Untold Story About The Games People Play</h2><p>There are very few major personalities in the world of sports who have so much to say about our National Pastime. And even fewer who are as well respected as Bill White.<br><br>Bill White, who's now in his mid 70s, was an All-Star first baseman for many years with the New York Giants, St.Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies before launching a stellar broadcasting career with the New York Yankees for 18 years. He left the broadcast booth to become the President of the National League for five years. <br><br>A true pioneer as an African-American athlete, sportscaster, and top baseball executive, White has written his long-awaited autobiography in which he will be candid, open, and as always, most forthcoming about his life in baseball. Along the way, White shares never-before-told stories about his long working relationship with Phil Rizzutto, insights on George Steinbrenner, Barry Bonds, Reggie Jackson, Thurman Munson, Bob Gibson, Bart Giamatti, Fay Vincent, and scores of other top baseball names and Hall of Famers. <br><br>Best of all, White built his career on being outspoken, and the years fortunately have not mellowed him. <strong>UPPITY</strong> is a baseball memoir that baseball fans everywhere will be buzzing about.</p><p>A former professional first baseman who played for the New York Giants, St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies. White became a full-time sportscaster for 18 years after his playing career ended. White then served as president of the National League from 1989 to 1994.<br><br>For years he was sought out by publishers to do his autobio but has always declined. Fortunately, we were able to convince him to go on the record.Honest, accomplished, and revered on and off the field, White, who played first base for the Giants, Cardinals, and Phillies, tells the story of his rise in baseball&#x2014;how he weathered the racist catcalls from the stands and inferior accommodations, considering it all a necessary evil at minor league ballparks in his preparation for the big leagues during the Jim Crow era. Old pros Monte Irvin and Willie Mays, who wrote the appreciative foreword, shepherded him through the rough times, along with the "tough love" shown by New York Giants manager Leo Durocher transforming White into an All-Star first baseman. Upon concluding his stellar career on first base with the St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies in 1969, he joined the colorful Phil Rizzuto in the broadcast booth to call New York Yankees games. His on-target comments about baseball's front office are grounded in the petty skirmishes and grand accomplishments of his five-year stint as president of the National League from 1989 to 1994. Sometimes brutally frank, White dishes the dirt on almost all of the leading baseball and broadcasting names in a truly controversial baseball memoir that will not be easily forgotten.

Kirra's younger sister, Casserah, provides her one. The newly titled Casserah is supposed to appear at the summer parties thrown by major lords of Gillengaria, but she could care less. Assuming Casserah's form, Kirra sets out on the social circuit in her stead to learn more about the nobles plotting to overthrow the king. Instead of taking the side of the ostensibly oppressed, Shinn dares to be a royalist, though not without sympathy to the underclasses. She brings back Kirra's companions from <i>Mystic and Rider</i>, adds several enjoyable new characters and paints their journey with a lyrical grace and deep appreciation of camaraderie reminiscent of Diane Duane at her best. Only the one-dimensional villain (always Shinn's weakest point) and the forehead-slapping stupidity of the infatuated lovers mar this superior fantasy series. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the first half of the war, the bulk of military operations were concentrated in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. A shift in British strategy southward after the Battle of Monmouth in 1778 triggered numerous military engagements in 1779 and 1780 in Georgia and the Carolinas.Surprisingly, Virginia, the largest of the original thirteen colonies, saw relatively little fighting for the first six years of the Revolutionary War. This changed in 1781 when British and American forces converged on Virginia. The war&#x2019;s arrival did not result from one particular decision or event, but rather, a series of incidents and battles beginning in the fall of 1780 at Kings Mountain, South Carolina.<br> Benedict Arnold&#x2019;s sudden appearance in Virginia in early 1781 with 1,600 seasoned British troops and his successful raid up the James River to Richmond and subsequent occupation of Portsmouth, demonstrated Virginia&#x2019;s vulnerability to attack and the possibility that the colonies could be divided and subdued piecemeal, a strategy Britain had attempted to deploy several times earlier in the war.&nbsp;British General Henry Clinton&#x2019;s decision to reinforce Arnold in Virginia expanded Britain&#x2019;s hold on the colony while events in North Carolina, including the battle of Guilford Court House, led British General Charles Cornwallis to conclude that defeating the Patriots in Virginia was the key to ending the war. As a result, Cornwallis marched his army north in May 1781 to assume command of what was now a very powerful British force of over 7,000 troops. The war had returned to Virginia with a vengeance, and how it did so and what happened as a result is the focus of <i>The Invasion of Virginia 1781</i>.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Michael Cecere received a BA at the University of Maine, Farmington, and an MA in history and an MA in political science from the University of Akron.

If almost constant sunshine weren&#39;t lure enough, 4500 miles of coastline is the clincher! Actually, the straight-line distance is about 1800 miles; some experts say the coastline is over 8000 miles if you count the coastline at every island and estuary. For millions who visit the Sunshine State each year, that means packing the fishing gear along with the suntan oil. Some fish are pretty cosmopolitan; a visiting angler might pull in a Tripletail just like the one he caught back home in Connecticut - or off the coast of Spain. But there&#39;s a good chance that the finny denizen hauled into his boat will be a breed apart from those he&#39;s used to snaring. The odds increase if he hails from South Dakota. Common names used are those approved by the American Fisheries Society. However, in some cases, local or &#34;dockside&#34; names have been added. Some of these are too colorful to omit, in spite of the confusion they cause. Consecutive numbers have been assigned to each fish in the text. These numbers appear on the color pages, and the color-page number is noted in the text where applicable.

A genius who throughout his life solved complex mathematical calculations in his head, and a writer gifted with an inimitable style, Poincar� rose to the challenge of interpreting the philosophy of science to scientists and nonscientists alike. His lucid and welcoming prose made him the Carl Sagan of his time. This volume collects his three most important books: <b>Science and Hypothesis</b> (1903); <b>The Value of Science</b> (1905); and<b> Science and Method </b>(1908).</p><p>Henri Poincar� was born in Nancy, France, in 1854. He joined the University of Paris in 1881 and lectured and wrote extensively on mathematics, experimental physics, and astronomy. His books have been translated into dozens of languages. In 1908, he was elected to membership in the Academie Fran�aise, the highest honor that can be accorded a French writer. He died in 1912.<br><br>Stephen Jay Gould is the Alexander Agassiz professor of zoology and professor of geology at Harvard and the Vincent Astor visiting professor of biology at New York University.

He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and New York City.<b>CHAPTER I <br>On the Nature of Mathematical Reasoning</b><br><br>I The very possibility of mathematical science seems an insoluble contradiction. If this science is only deductive in appearance, from whence is derived that perfect rigour which is challenged by none? If, on the contrary, all the propositions which it enunciates may be derived in order by the rules of formal logic, how is it that mathematics is not reduced to a gigantic tautology? The syllogism can teach us nothing essentially new, and if everything must spring from the principle of identity, then everything should be capable of being reduced to that principle. Are we then to admit that the enunciations of all the theorems with which so many volumes are filled are only indirect ways of saying that A is A?<br><br>No doubt we may refer back to axioms which are at the source of all these reasonings. If it is felt that they cannot be reduced to the principle of contradiction, if we decline to see in them any more than experimental facts which have no part or lot in mathematical necessity, there is still one resource left to us: we may class them among � priori synthetic views. But this is no solution of the difficulty&#x2014;it is merely giving it a name; and even if the nature of the synthetic views had no longer for us any mystery, the contradiction would not have disappeared; it would have only been shirked. Syllogistic reasoning remains incapable of adding anything to the data that are given it; the data are reduced to axioms, and that is all we should find in the conclusions.<br><br>No theorem can be new unless a new axiom intervenes in its demonstration; reasoning can only give us immediately evident truths borrowed from direct intuition; it would only be an intermediary parasite. Should we not therefore have reason for asking if the syllogistic apparatus serves only to disguise what we have borrowed?<br><br>The contradiction will strike us the more if we open any book on mathematics; on every page the author announces his intention of generalising some proposition already known. Does the mathematical method proceed from the particular to the general, and, if so, how can it be called deductive?<br><br>Finally, if the science of number were merely analytical, or could be analytically derived from a few synthetic intuitions, it seems that a sufficiently powerful mind could with a single glance perceive all its truths; nay, one might even hope that some day a language would be invented simple enough for these truths to be made evident to any person of ordinary intelligence.<br><br>Even if these consequences are challenged, it must be granted that mathematical reasoning has of itself a kind of creative virtue, and is therefore to be distinguished from the syllogism. The difference must be profound. We shall not, for instance, find the key to the mystery in the frequent use of the rule by which the same uniform operation applied to two equal numbers will give identical results. All these modes of reasoning, whether or not reducible to the syllogism, properly so called, retain the analytical character, and ipso facto, lose their power.<br><br>II The argument is an old one. Let us see how Leibnitz tried to show that two and two make four. I assume the number one to be defined, and also the operation x11&#x2014;i.e., the adding of unity to a given number x. These definitions, whatever they may be, do not enter into the subsequent reasoning. I next define the numbers 2, 3, 4 by the equalities:<br><br>(1) 11152; (2) 21153; (3) 31154, and in the same way I define the operation x12 by the relation; (4) x125(x11)11.<br><br>Given this, we have:<br><br>2125(211)11; (def. 4). (211)115311(def. 2). 31154(def. 3). whence 21254 Q.E.D.<br><br>It cannot be denied that this reasoning is purely analytical. But if we ask a mathematician, he will reply: &#x201c;This is not a demonstration properly so called; it is a verification.&#x201d; We have confined ourselves to bringing together one or other of two purely conventional definitions, and we have verified their identity; nothing new has been learned. Verification differs from proof precisely because it is analytical, and because it leads to nothing. It leads to nothing because the conclusion is nothing but the premisses translated into another language. A real proof, on the other hand, is fruitful, because the conclusion is in a sense more general than the premisses. The equality 21254 can be verified because it is particular. Each individual enunciation in mathematics may be always verified in the same way. But if mathematics could be reduced to a series of such verifications it would not be a science. A chess-player, for instance, does not create a science by winning a piece. There is no science but the science of the general. It may even be said that the object of the exact sciences is to dispense with these direct verifications.<br><br>III Let us now see the geometer at work, and try to surprise some of his methods. The task is not without difficulty; it is not enough to open a book at random and to analyse any proof we may come across. First of all, geometry must be excluded, or the question becomes complicated by difficult problems relating to the role of the postulates, the nature and the origin of the idea of space. For analogous reasons we cannot avail ourselves of the infinitesimal calculus. We must seek mathematical thought where it has remained pure&#x2014;i.e., in Arithmetic. But we still have to choose; in the higher parts of the theory of numbers the primitive mathematical ideas have already undergone so profound an elaboration that it becomes difficult to analyse them.<br><br>It is therefore at the beginning of Arithmetic that we must expect to find the explanation we seek; but it happens that it is precisely in the proofs of the most elementary theorems that the authors of classic treatises have displayed the least precision and rigour. We may not impute this to them as a crime; they have obeyed a necessity. Beginners are not prepared for real mathematical rigour; they would see in it nothing but empty, tedious subtleties. It would be a waste of time to try to make them more exacting; they have to pass rapidly and without stopping over the road which was trodden slowly by the founders of the science.<br><br>Why is so long a preparation necessary to habituate oneself to this perfect rigour, which it would seem should naturally be imposed on all minds? This is a logical and psychological problem which is well worthy of study. But we shall not dwell on it; it is foreign to our subject. All I wish to insist on is that we shall fail in our purpose unless we reconstruct the proofs of the elementary theorems, and give them, not the rough form in which they are left so as not to weary the beginner, but the form which will satisfy the skilled geometer.<br><br>Definition of Addition I assume that the operation x11 has been defined; it consists in adding the number 1 to a given number x. Whatever may be said of this definition, it does not enter into the subsequent reasoning.<br><br>We now have to define the operation x1a, which consists in adding the number a to any given number x. Suppose that we have defined the operation x1(a21); the operation x1a will be defined by the equality: (1) x1a5[x1(a21)]11. We shall know what x1a is when we know what x1(a-1) is, and as I have assumed that to start with we know what x11 is, we can define successively and &#x201c;by recurrence&#x201d; the operations x12, x13, etc. This definition deserves a moment&#x2019;s attention; it is of a particular nature which distinguishes it even at this stage from the purely logical definition; the equality (1), in fact, contains an infinite number of distinct definitions, each having only one meaning when we know the meaning of its predecessor.<br><br>Properties of Addition Associative. I say that a1(b1c)5(a1b)1c; in fact, the theorem is true for c51. It may then be written a1(b11)5(a1b)11; which, remembering the difference of notation, is nothing but the equality (1) by which I have just defined addition. Assume the theorem true for c5g, I say that it will be true for c5g11. Let (a1b)1g5 a1(b1g), it follows that [(a1b)1g]115[a1(b1g)]11; or by def. (1)&#x2014;(a1b)1(g11)5a1(b1g11)5a1[b1(g11)], which shows by a series of purely analytical deductions that the theorem is true for g11. Being true for c51, we see that it is successively true for c52, c53, etc.<br><br>Commutative. (1) I say that a11511a. The theorem is evidently true for a51; we can verify by purely analytical reasoning that if it is true for a5g it will be true for a5g11.* Now, it is true for a51, and therefore is true for a52, a53, and so on. This is what is meant by saying that the proof is demonstrated &#x201c;by recurrence.&#x201d;<br><br>(2) I say that a1b5b1a. The theorem has just been shown to hold good for b51, and it may be verified analytically that if it is true for b5b, it will be true for b5b11. The proposition is thus established by recurrence.<br><br>* For (g11)115(11g)11511(g11).&#x2014;[Tr.] Definition of Multiplication We shall define multiplication by the equalities: (1) a315a. (2) a3b5[a3(b-1)]1a. Both of these include an infinite number of definitions; having defined a31, it enables us to define in succession a32, a33, and so on. Properties of Multiplication Distributive. I say that (a1b)3c5(a3c)1(b3c). We can verify analytically that the theorem is true for c51; then if it is true for c5g, it will be true for c5g11. The proposition is then proved by recurrence.<br><br>Commutative. (1) I say that a31513a. The theorem is obvious for a51. We can verify analytically that if it is true for a5a, it will be true for a5a11.<br><br>(2) I say that a3b5b3a. The theorem has just been proved for b51. We can verify analytically that if it be true for b5b it will be true for b5b11. IV This monotonous series of reasonings may now be laid aside; but their very monotony brings vividly to light the process, which is uniform, and is met again at every step. The process is proof by recurrence. We first show that a theorem is true for n51; we then show that if it is true for n21 it is true for n, and we conclude that it is true for all integers. We have now seen how it may be used for the proof of the rules of addition and multiplication&#x2014;that is to say, for the rules of the algebraic calculus. This calculus is an instrument of transformation which lends itself to many more different combinations than the simple syllogism; but it is still a purely analytical instrument, and is incapable of teaching us anything new. If mathematics had no other instrument, it would immediately be arrested in its development; but it has recourse anew to the same process&#x2014;i.e., to reasoning by recurrence, and it can continue its forward march. Then if we look carefully, we find this mode of reasoning at every step, either under the simple form which we have just given to it, or under a more or less modified form. It is therefore mathematical reasoning par excellence, and we must examine it closer.</p><h2>A Treasury of Tom Thomson</h2><p>In the spring of 1918 Lawren Harris and J.E.H. MacDonald, two members of the soon-to-be-formed Group of Seven, met in the Studio Building in Toronto. Their friend Tom Thomson had died in mysterious circumstances the year before and, together, they determined to establish him as one of Canada's great artists. Most of his paintings and sketches were stacked up in the studio, and they decided on a plan. They would select the best, mark their comments on the back of these works, and make sure they got into Canada's most prestigious public and private collections.<br> These two great artists choose to honour Thomson in this way because they had been his mentors and friends. Along with other painters such as A.Y. Jackson, they had taught him about current art movements in Europe and coached him in painting techniques. Thomson learned quickly, and, in the three or four years before his death, he combined this knowledge and these skills with his own prodigious talent and intimacy with nature. His friends recognized that, in many ways, they would never be able to paint like him. The pupil had become the master - and Harris and MacDonald, together with Jackson, wanted to be sure that he would be recognized and remembered.<br>In later years, collectors such as Ken Thomson and Robert McMichael assembled their selection of Thomson masterpieces, as did private collectors today. Art historian Joan Murray has constructed this treasury with all these choices in mind - and written an insightful commentary on each one. Knowing the story that lies behind Thomson's greatest works helps us to view these paintings with new insight and appreciation. We understand what makes these works special.<br></p><p>Joan Murray, an independent curator and art historian, is considered one of the most accessible of Canadian art writers and has studied and exhibited Tom Thomson for four decades.<br></p><h2>Savage Grace: Living Resiliently in the Dark Night of the Globe</h2><p><p>In the boldest and most daring book either author has ever written, Andrew Harvey and Carolyn Baker confront us with the life and death reality of the global crisis and the fact that four crucial strategies must be employed not only to survive the dark night, but to inhabit our bodies and our lives with passionate authenticity, honesty, vigilance, community, compassion, and service. These strategies are Reconnection, Resistance, Resilience, and Regeneration. Deep and unprecedented reconnection with self, others, and Earth must be our mission, regardless of the outcome. Distinguishing between &#x201c;problems&#x201d; which have solutions and &#x201c;predicaments&#x201d; which can only be responded to, Harvey and Baker articulate precisely how we have arrived at this unprecedented juncture and offer strategies of resistance against the fundamental enemies of humanity and the Earth. Such a response demands of us something far deeper than what conventional religions and visions of activism call for--nothing less than living and acting from the Sacred Self, both without illusion and totally committed to compassion and justice even, if necessary, in hopeless situations.</p><p>With Trump, it&#x2019;s as if the Titanic has hit the iceberg.

Now renowned Celtic scholar Caitl�n Matthews, drawing on a full range of medieval texts and ancient Welsh writings, provides a fully revised and updated reader's guide to these rich and far-reaching tales. <br><br>In <i>King Arthur and the Goddess of the Land</i>, Matthews sheds particular light on Sovereignty, the Goddess of the sacred land of Britain, and the spiritual principle of the Divine Feminine. Clearly revealed are the many alternate forms taken by the Goddess of the Land--including her incarnation as Morgan of Avalon, who plays a dominant role in the Arthurian cycle. Also established are links between the legendary characters of the Mabinogion and their counterparts in other living myths of the Western world. Through the marriage of the Celtic kings to the Goddess of the Land, the sacred contract between political rulership and responsibility for the land's well-being is dramatically revealed. In King Arthur and the Goddess of the Land, Matthews once again articulates definitively the continuing relevance of ancient Celtic thought and belief as illustrated in the powerful myths and legends of ancient Britain.</p><p>Caitlin Matthews is internationally renowned for her research into the Celtic and ancestral traditions. She is the author of 36 books, including <i>The Celtic Tradition, The Encyclopedia of Celtic Wisdom</i>, and <i>Sophia: Goddess of Wisdom</i>.

The land cannot be won without battles, but in the end everyone finds that sovereignty is both beautiful and glorious.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Echtra Mac Echach Muigmedoin&#x201d; <br> The Fame of Arthur, Undying King <br> <br> Arthur lives in the imagination and soul of the people. He is the focus and burning glass for many aspirations, combining the heroic endeavors of the pagan world with the spiritual chivalry of Christian Europe. Arthur&#x2019;s grave, as the early Welsh poems Englynion y Beddau (Stanzas on the Graves) tell us, is an unthinkable sepulchre; he has not died but dwells in Avalon--he will come again. The legends in which he figures have currency among both the very simple and the very wise because of the Arthurian world&#x2019;s immediacy in human terms and because its stories operate on many levels. <br> The Matter of Britain, as the stories of Arthur are called, is a very subtle blend of stories, history, traditions, and beliefs; its followers are likewise various&#x2014;literary critics, medievalists, and folklorists mingle with those who like the stories for their own sake. There are others for whom Arthur has become a cult figure. He is hero and god,120 a being whose identity is worthy of assuming within the confines of a war game or role-playing scenario,147 a model which psychologists can apply to patients&#x2019; unconscious functions, and an inspiration to mythographers and metaphyscians.47, 86 Arthur is the stuff of epic film, novel, and enduring mythic heroism. <br> This Arthurian mystique has been copiously studied and extrapolated. Despite the protestations of rationalists that evidence for the historical Arthur is thin on the ground, the argument that he did exist will not go away. Reverence for Arthur has at various times assumed a semi-mystical fervor which scholars have found distasteful, for to them it surpasses the respect properly due to someone whom they regard as a literary invention and it teeters on the verge of the downright heretical. How has this come about? <br> The medieval literary corpus of Arthurian stories that most of us know is only one stratum of the excavation in question. If we look deeper, the literary evidence becomes thinner, but what does exist reveals quite a different picture of Arthur. One existing source is the Mabinogion, which, though first written down between 1100 and 1250 C.E., was the product of a rich oral tradition and preserves a portrait of Arthur and features of his career that might baffle someone familiar with the great king only through late-medieval sources. <br> For a start, Arthur was not a noble king based on the Norman or Plantagenet model; he was a warlord surrounded by his war band which was not above a little cattle-raiding or pig-reiving, according to the Welsh Triads.38 In texts like Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x2019;s History of the Kings of Britain,10 Arthur performs his own deeds rather than sending one of his knights to carry them out on his behalf. We are continually struck, however, by the way in which Arthur seems to move effortlessly between the earthly realms and the Otherworld, for he seems at home in both. <br> And here, perhaps, we are at the root of the mystery, for Arthur blends skillfully into a mythological hinterland which is even now only just being comprehended. His power to excite reverence or mystical fervor is due in no small part to his connection with and relationship to deeply rooted mythological archetypes arising from the land of Britain. While it was &#x201c;almost a miracle if he could extract a tear at a pious reading or discourse,&#x201d; St. Ailred of Rievaulx wrote of an unnamed novice in 1141 C.E., it is no wonder that this novice &#x201c;had frequently been moved to tears by fables which were invented and dissembled concerning an unknown Arthur&#x201d;92--for the consciousness of that time more easily swarmed with native and familiar archetypes than with those propounded by St. Ailred and his fellow clerics. <br> In the same way in which saints stepped into the shoes of native deities, so the medieval King Arthur replaced the earlier proto-Celtic Arthur, who was in turn a resonance of a mythic archetype of ancestral memory. Mythic identities, like suits of clothes, are changed or appropriated easily. In Mabon and the Guardians of Celtic Britain111 I attempted to show how one mythic motif percolated through British tradition to take in figures as diverse as Arthur, Bran the Blessed, and Mabon himself. In this volume my intentions are to show another kind of mythic archetype, that of Sovereignty, the Goddess of the Land, for it is through her that Arthur earns much of the supernatural reverence surrounding him. His association with her and her representatives will be detailed in chapter 10. <br> Arthur&#x2019;s reputation seems, from medieval accounts, to be based solely on his Round Table knights and their exploits and on his notable birth and passing into Avalon. In fact, Arthur&#x2019;s is a submerged reputation based on deeds and exploits whose traces can be discovered in extant early literary sources. In these episodes, such as the &#x201c;Preiddeu Annwfn&#x201d; (The Spoils of Annwfn--Mabon, chapter 6), in which we see him traveling in his ship, Prydwen, to steal the empowering symbols known as the hallows, he is dressed in his mythic guise, fulfilling an ancient, redemptive action in order to return balance to the land of Britain. In doing so, Arthur is the earliest Grail winner, establishing a pattern that is followed by Perceval, Bors, and Galahad in the later texts.</p><h2>Treasure in Clay Jars: Patterns in Missional Faithfulness (The Gospel and Our Culture Series (GOCS))</h2><p>If you saw a missional church, what would it look like? What patterns of behavior and practice would you find there?<br><br> Building on the ground laid by the book&nbsp;<i>Missional Church: A Vision for the Sending of the Church in North America</i>&nbsp;(Darrell Guder et al. 1998),&nbsp;<i>Treasure in Clay Jars</i>&nbsp;centers on case studies of nine missional congregations from across North America that are diverse in their denominational affiliations, worship styles, political stances, and socioeconomic backgrounds. The book explores eight concrete "patterns" common to these churches. Although the patterns may be different in each setting, they can be recognized in any congregation seeking to participate in God's mission in the world.<br><br> The team that authored this book believes that "missional" says something not so much about the activities of the church as its character: "The church does not exist for itself, but for participation in God's mission of reconciliation. . . . Mission is the character of the church in whatever context it exists." The congregations studied here are "clay jars," but each carries in its witness a remarkable treasure that points to God's power and purposes.<br><br><b>Authors:</b><br> Lois Y.

One frequently hears the plaint that books about the church and mission are too heady and make little contact with what goes on at the local level. The backbone of this work is case studies of congregations, ranging from Holy Ghost Full Gospel Baptist Church to Transfiguration Roman Catholic Parish in Brooklyn, alive to their calling to be the people of God in the world. Rather than suggesting that these churches furnish us with ideal models, this book emphasizes eight&nbsp;<i>missional practices</i>&nbsp;that characterize the local church committed to God's mission.<i>Treasure in Clay Jars</i>&nbsp;is a worthy sequel to&nbsp;<i>Missional Church.</i>"</p><h2>Forgotten Journey</h2><p><p><em>Forgotten Journey</em>, a collection of 28 short stories first published in 1937, was the world&#x2019;s introduction to Silvina Ocampo, considered one of Argentina&#x2019;s most original and iconic authors. With it, Ocampo initiated a personal, idiosyncratic politics of memory, writing in what would become her signature lyrical, oneiric, and slightly menacing style, a theme to which she would return again and again over the course of her long and productive career.

These cover the range of doctrinal, ecclesiastical and practical subjects. They are characterized by profundity, thoroughness and, consequestly, authority. Andrew Thomson said that Owen &#39;makes you feel when he has reached the end of his subject, that he has also exhausted it.&#39; Although many of his works were called forth by the particular needs of his own day they all have a uniform quality of timelessness. Owen&#39;s works were republished in full in the nineteenth century. Owen is surely the Prince of the Puritans. &#39;To master his works&#39;, says Spurgeon, &#39;is to be a profound theologian.&#39;</p><p>John Owen (1616-1683) was an early Puritan advocate of Congregationalism and Reformed theology. Educated at Queen&#39;s College, Oxford, he served under the Puritan government of Oliver Cromwell as personal chaplain to Cromwell and later as vice-chancellor of Oxford. A contemporary of John Bunyan, Owen&#39;s extensive body of work includes some twenty-eight books on theological and devotional themes. His later years were spent in pastoral ministry where he served as the leading spokesman for the Protestant Nonconformists.I first read John Owen's 'Of Communion with God' while a theological student (in the middle 1960s). It made beautifully clear and confirmed the theological underpinnings of the atmosphere I had lived in within the family and local congregation from earliest days: that God is love, that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit, to know Christ is to be near the heart of the Father; that to dwell in God is to dwell in love: God's love to us and our love back to God and to others. Owen, with skillful scriptural exegesis and warmest pastoral insight takes us to the very heart of Christianity in this treatise, and shows us that this, and this alone is worth living for; this alone makes sense of everything else, and irradiates every step of earthly life with strength, hope and joy. That is why, forty years later, I still delight to pick up this grand treatise and read from it as a sort of 'vade mecum'. We owe a debt of gratitude of Philip Ross for beautifully editing this long discourse, and making it far more accessible to another generation. He has skillfully and accurately divided up long 'Pauline sentences' into manageable portions; he has clarified some rather obscure vocabulary, and - perhaps best of all - he has inserted very lucid and helpful subheadings and other divisions, which make the otherwise demanding text much easier to follow. All through, he has remained eminently faithful to the original meaning. The beauty of John Owen's theology, and most of all, the beauty of the love of God in Christ to us needy souls shines through. I shall be enthusiastically recommending this new volume to my classes (Douglas F. Kelly ~ Professor of Theology Emeritus, Reformed Theological Seminary, Charlotte, North Carolina)<br><br>"I owe an incalculable debt to these pages. For forty years now this has been a favourite volume to which I continue to return for more 'angel food'" (Sinclair B. Ferguson ~ Associate Preacher, St. Peter's Free Church, Dundee)<br><br>"Owen was by common consent the weightiest Puritan theologian, and many would bracket him with Jonathan Edwards as one of the greatest Reformed theologians of all time."

Armed with a list of ingredients, she tracked down each component of her scent, tracing its origins, history, and culture.<br><br> From the iris fields of Tuscany to the vetivert distilleries of India, from the nutmeg plantations of Sri Lanka to the shores of the Arabian Sea, Celia gives readers a glimpse into the world of scent that few people have ever experienced, providing delicious details on its place in history?for example, how Casanova added small amounts of ambergris to chocolate mousses to aid his amorous adventures, and how Charles Dickens carried a monogrammed pocket nutmeg grater in his waist coat at a time when nutmeg was used to ward off evil and to spice rum.</p><p>Celia Lyttelton is an artist and a journalist. She has written for <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Tatler</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>World of Interiors</i>, the <i>Sunday Times</i> and <i>Harpers &amp; Queen</i>.For globe-trotting British journalist Lyttelton, scent evokes memories. Such memories from her childhood, when she traveled with her archeologist mother to distant countries, led her to embark on a quest to find scent origins around the world. Seeking her own bespoke perfume, she visits a London perfumer, introducing readers to the delicate art of composing a perfume, evoking, for instance, a forest at dawn soaked in dew or, more abstractly, a piece of music. With her own formula in hand, Lyttelton sets out to visit places where the ingredients are grown, hoping to meet the harvesters, encounter fragrant fumes and discover the secrets of perfume making. Lyttelton has a magical manner of blending words and sentences to summon up splendiferous odors amid her anecdotes, memories and historical research. Scented sentences permeate the pages as she takes the reader along on her olfactory odyssey across far-flung, labyrinthine landscapes, from the French Riviera and Morocco to Tuscany and Sri Lanka. Her enchanting escapades conclude with a glossary of terminology used by perfumers. <i>(Feb. 3)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chekhov's singular ability to speak volumes with a single, impeccably chosen word, mesh comedy and pathos, and capture life's basic sadness as he entertains us, are why so many aspire to emulate him. <i>How to Write Like Chekhov</i> meticulously cherry-picks from Chekhov's plays, stories, and letters to his publisher, brother, and friends, offering suggestions and observations on subjects including plot and characters (and their names), descriptions and dialogue, and what to emphasize and avoid. This is a uniquely clear roadmap to Chekhov's intelligence and artistic expertise and an essential addition to the writing-guide shelf.</p><p><b>Piero Brunello</b> is a professor at the University of Venice. <b>Lena Lencek</b> is a professor at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.Starred Review. Edited by professors Brunello and Lencek, this writing primer makes a thorough guide to the spare, realist style that made Chekhov one of the world's greatest playwrights and short story writers. Drawing specific (and more oblique) literary advice from Chekhov's correspondence and his experimental travel memoir The Island of Sakhalin (perhaps his most ambitious and personal project), the editors develop an insightful, practical outline of Chekhov's literary approach. Following Lencek's intelligent introduction, advice is helpfully broken down by topic, covering general questions of audience, subject and approach ("Witness, Don't Judge"); specific issues like plot, character and emotion ("Knowing How to Suffer"); observation and reporting ("Study the Graffiti"); and "the actual writing" ("Tell Stories as They Were Told"). Both Chekhov's correspondence and his excerpts prove interesting and illustrative, especially the work from Sakhalin that cast him as writer, ethnographer, tourist and census-taker. Including a "who's who" of Chekhov's pen pals and suggestion for further reading, this is a useful and smart guide for writers of all kinds. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A century ago, however, Luther Burbank's blight-resistant potatoes, white blackberries, and plumcots-a plum-apricot hybrid-were celebrated as triumphs in the best tradition of American ingenuity and perseverance. In his experimental grounds in Santa Rosa, California, Burbank bred and cross-bred edible and ornamental plants-for both home gardens and commercial farms-until they were bigger, hardier, more beautiful, and more productive than ever before. A fascinating portrait of an American original, <i>The Garden of Invention</i> is also a colorful and engrossing tale of the intersection of gardening, science and business in the years between the Civil War and the Great Depression.</p><p><b>Jane S. Smith</b> writes about the intersection of nature, science, and social change. Her history of the first polio vaccine, <i>Patenting the Sun: Polio and the Salk Vaccine</i>, was awarded the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Science and Technology. She received her Ph.D. in English from Yale University and has taught at Northwestern University on topics ranging from twentieth-century fiction to the history of public health. She lives in Chicago, where she works in a very small room with a very large window.Though as famous in his day as Thomas Edison, agricultural pioneer Luther Burbank (1849&#x2013;1926) is little remembered; in this straightforward, engaging biography, author and historian Smith (<i>Patenting the Sun: Polio and the Salk Vaccine</i>) recounts Burbank's life and its context, chronicling also agribusiness's turn-of-the-century growth and industrialization. Smith covers Burbank's rural New England childhood; the influence of Darwin on his horticultural ideas; his move to Santa Rosa, Calif.; and the establishment of his experimental gardens and nurseries. Amazingly, Burbank discovered independently the Mendelian principles that form the basis of genetics, and developed more than 800 varieties of fruits, nuts, vegetables and flowers. He made little money, largely owing to insufficient patent law (plants were not covered at the time) and his own paranoia, but he gained ample fame amid the 19th-century vogue for progress. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He leaned back in the old wooden chair and crossed arms that were as thick as oak beams over his chest. His eyes carried a dangerous, glassy sheen C.J. knew too well.</p><p>He should&#x2019;ve never let the big man into his bar. It was obvious the guy and his companions had already had a few too many before ever stepping into the Ancient Mariner.

It was Wednesday night, and on a Wednesday night of all nights, he didn&#x2019;t want a fight in the middle of his joint. But principles were principles, and poor Sheila was still huddled in the corner, terrified, after being pinched by Paul Bunyan here. C.J. didn&#x2019;t stand for disorderly conduct in his place, and he definitely didn&#x2019;t stand for any guy manhandling a woman.</p><p>As far as C.J. could tell, there was only one thing to do.</p><p>&#x201c;You got two options,&#x201d; he explained again. &#x201c;The easy way or the hard way.&#x201d;</p><p>He rolled his neck and shrugged out his shoulders. At five ten and one hundred and sixty pounds, he hardly intimidated the larger man. The regulars in the bar who knew better were quietly placing bets with the people who didn&#x2019;t know so much. Behind the bar, Gus was unsheathing her knife just to be safe. If these big brutes thought C.J. was harmless, just wait until they saw what Gus could do with a bowie knife.</p><p>C.J. wasn&#x2019;t nervous. He&#x2019;d faced bigger opponents, tougher opponents, more numerous opponents in his life. At this point, he just wanted these drunkards out of his bar with the least amount of damage possible.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; C.J. said at last. &#x201c;The hard way it is.&#x201d;</p><p>He rolled up his shirtsleeves and assumed a boxer&#x2019;s stance. &#x201c;Come on, big fella.

Obviously, he hadn&#x2019;t walked into the Ancient Mariner for the beer.</p><p>C.J.&#x2019;s pulse picked up.

C.J. shook his head and stood his ground. At the last second, he feinted right.

You, too.&#x201d;</p><p>Twiddly Dee and Twiddly Dumb advanced. C.J. let them crash into the bar once apiece just to be neighborly. After a bit of heavy grunting and fist clenching, the threesome decided for a group rush, costing him two perfectly good tables and one already taped-?�together chair. The locals groaned, then cheered as he took a solid right hook, recovered and danced away on the balls of his feet. He knew how to move, take a blow and bounce back up like a human Weeble Wobble. What growing up poor on the streets of L.A. hadn&#x2019;t taught him, the marines had jammed down his throat in eight weeks of do-?�or-?�die boot camp.</p><p>C.J. got serious. He blocked out the locals&#x2019; cheers, Gus&#x2019;s scowl and Sheila&#x2019;s concern. He focused on the men before him, the adrenaline throbbing in his veins, along with the small ore of anger that snaked through him on random occasions. The part of him that never forgot the hunger of L.A., or the agony of his mother dying, or his father leaving him that final time for the skies of Indonesia.</p><p>C.J. moved. Jab, jab, followed by two feints and a dozen rapid-?�fire punches. The three men dropped one, two, three, making loud thuds on his red ?�tiled floor.</p><p>Thirty seconds later, C.J. stood in the middle of the floor, his breathing slightly heavy as the locals swapped cash, shook their heads at the drunken fools and returned their attention to the small TV set up in the corner. C.J. lingered just to be sure, but Paul Bunyan and his friends remained down for the count. He was half satisfied, half saddened by that. His little sister, Maggie, was right&#x2014;?�he enjoyed fighting too much.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, all right,&#x201d; Gus grumbled, coming out from behind the bar. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show them to the door.&#x201d;</p><p>She shuffled her bulk toward the fallen forms, not in any hurry. A Hopi Indian, she was shorter than C.J., but a great deal more imposing. Her thick black hair was liberally streaked with gray and worn in a tight ponytail at the nape of her neck. She never wore jewelry, just the hideous, twisting scars on her face that hinted of untold stories. C.J. had shared the bar with her for almost six years. He had no idea where she came from, what she&#x2019;d done, or where she might be going. He figured the first time he asked, she&#x2019;d simply give him her flat black stare, then pack her bags and leave.</p><p>Now she leaned over the groaning men and smiled in a way that twisted her scarred face even more grotesquely. One man opened his eyes, gave a little yelp and squeezed them shut again.</p><p>&#x201c;Taking out the trash, Gus?&#x201d; one of the regulars chortled.</p><p>&#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s gotta.&#x201d;</p><p>C.J. left the locals to recap the victory and exaggerate the details. He crossed to Sheila, who stood with her arms wrapped around her middle in a stance that reminded him even more of Maggie.</p><p>&#x201c;How you doing, kid?&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugged weakly. Until recently, her primary occupation had been serving as a punching bag for her alcoholic husband. Then, four weeks ago, Mary Campbell from the local church had called C.J., stated Sheila was trying to leave her abusive husband and asked if C.J. would give her a job as a cocktail waitress. He&#x2019;d agreed instantly, of course. When Sheila had turned out to have no training, he spent Monday walking her through the drill himself. When she&#x2019;d flinched the first time the bar got too rowdy, he&#x2019;d harassed his regulars into settling down. When she&#x2019;d paled at the thought of having to weave in and out of so many men, he&#x2019;d re�arranged the tables so she&#x2019;d have a wider aisle.</p><p>The regulars had been teasing him about it ever since. &#x201c;Yep, there goes C.J. again, rescuing another damsel, drying another tear. Think if we were blondes he&#x2018;d treat us so well?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; C.J. had retorted. &#x201c;Because you guys would make damn ugly blondes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let a big bully like that scare you,&#x201d; C.J. drawled lightly now. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re tougher than he is.&#x201d;</p><p>Sheila finally smiled, but it still didn&#x2019;t reach her eyes. He gave her another moment.</p><p>&#x201c;Want to take the rest of the evening off?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I need the money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only one night. Business isn&#x2019;t that great.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Really.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sweetheart, you look like you&#x2019;re going to faint.&#x201d;</p><p>Her lips thinned. She looked uncertain; then abruptly she squared her shoulders. &#x201c;I can do it. I . . . ?I need to do it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right, it was just a suggestion. Prove me wrong. See if I care.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do that.&#x201d; She slanted him a narrow look. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have to fight him. You can&#x2019;t fight everyone who pinches a woman&#x2019;s butt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In my bar, yes, I can.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have to learn to handle men like that sooner or later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, next time I&#x2019;ll hold him and you can beat him up. You are becoming more like my sister, Maggie.&#x201d; He said that a bit wistfully. He&#x2019;d always regarded himself as his little sister&#x2019;s protector, her number one knight in shining armor. Maggie didn&#x2019;t need him anymore, though. She&#x2019;d found herself a convicted murderer instead, and C.J. had given up ever understanding women. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re okay?&#x201d; he quizzed Sheila again, just to be sure.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, let&#x2019;s get this show back on the road, then.&#x201d;</p><p>He strode back to the center of the bar, already picking up the shattered chairs.</p><p>&#x201c;Never met a stray dog or troubled woman he didn&#x2019;t love,&#x201d; Gus muttered from behind the bar to no one in particular. &#x201c;He sure ain&#x2019;t gonna die of old age.&#x201d;</p><p>At one a.m., C.J. closed up shop, kicking the last four regulars out the door. It being Wednesday night, most of the locals had work the next day. Sedona existed thanks to year-?�round tourism, a few plush resorts to attract the really rich moths and a solid collection of excellent art galleries. Most of the Ancient Mariner&#x2019;s clientele were the rugged blue-?�collar workers fueling the white-?�collar vacations. The Jeep-?�tour guides, the hot-air balloon guides, the helicopter pilots. The laundry boys and &#x201c;customer service representatives&#x201d; from the various resorts. The kind of people who worked hard looking at how the other half lived and knowing they&#x2019;d never be them. They worked hard, anyway, and at the end of the day, they wanted to kick back, listen to some good old-?�fashioned rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll and enjoy a cold beer.</p><p>C.J. had bought the Ancient Mariner with the money he&#x2019;d saved while in the marines, and he&#x2019;d kept it a locals&#x2019; hangout. The red-?�tiled floor was scuffed up and boot-?�friendly. Navajo print rugs added warm colors to beat-?�up wood walls. The tables and chairs still sported the deeply carved initials of long-?�since-?�grown reprobates. It was a place for relaxing, telling stories of the New Yorkers who wore designer wool beneath the Arizona sun or the Texans who considered the Red Rocks to be mere pebbles. Guides could brag about how many people they&#x2019;d stuffed into a hot-air balloon, or how many kids had gotten sick on them that day.</p><p>C.J. would shake his head and not believe any of them.</p><p>Now he walked to the corner of the room and picked up the TV remote. A news update stated that police still had no leads on the mysterious murder of Spider Wallace, the ignominious cemetery caretaker who&#x2019;d been gunned down last week in his own graveyard. In other news, Senator George Brennan, Arizona&#x2019;s fine senator, was rumored to be on the verge of announcing his candidacy for president. He was arriving in Sedona&#x2014;?�his hometown&#x2014;?�next week for a vacation. Insiders predicted he&#x2019;d declare his intentions then. The old &#x201c;local boy makes good&#x201d; angle.</p><p>C.J. clicked off the TV. He didn&#x2019;t care for politics. Death and taxes were enough guaranteed suffering for any man. He placed the remote on top of the TV, stacked the rest of the chairs on the wiped-?�down tables and looked around. Gus had finished cleaning the bar and was now closing out the register. Sheila was sweeping the floor.</p><p>Everything was under control as it had been last night and the night before that and the night before that. In addition to running the bar, C.J. did some part-?�time work as a &#x201c;bail enforcement officer&#x201d;&#x2014;?�bounty hunter&#x2014;?�to keep his reflexes sharp. He hadn&#x2019;t had a case for a while and he could feel it now. He wasn&#x2019;t unhappy; he was just . . . ?restless. Dissatisfied.</p><p>Lonely.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you going home or you gonna stare at us all night?&#x201d; Gus grumbled.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going.&#x201d; He was still standing in his bar, though. He found himself thinking of his father, Max, and that strange year the two of them had whizzed around the globe so Max could conduct his business as &#x201c;importer-?�exporter.&#x201d; He saw his mother, pale and ethereal, as she&#x2019;d lain dying in their shabby studio apartment, still loving a man who was too busy traveling to come home.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, boss man. Get outta here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah, yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>His black convertible Mustang had a five-?�liter engine and brand-?�new tires. He pulled back the top so the clear, warm night wrapped around him. Crickets chirped. The wind carried the spicy, clean scent of creosote.</p><p>He hit the back road hard. An experienced SCCA race driver, he took the first corner at seventy-?�five and the third at ninety. In the straightaway, he came close to triple digits, practicing the speed and control he was learning at the tracks, though his grandmother&#x2019;s voice kept whispering in his ear that this wasn&#x2019;t the place for it. He found the line of the curving road, double-?�clutched for the next corner and hit it at seventy-?�five. His tires squealed.</p><p>For the first time, headlights appeared behind him&#x2014;?�distant, faint beams.</p><p>&#x201c;Cop?&#x201d; His foot slipped instantly off the gas, but then he frowned.</p><p>The lights were growing in his mirror. Belatedly, he realized that could only mean the car was gaining on him and he was still over ninety. His gaze locked on his mirror. The other car was definitely going really damn fast, probably around a hundred and five, and still hadn&#x2019;t put on any sirens. The S curves were about to appear.</p><p>C.J. downshifted, taking the set of three corners at fifty-?�five and hearing his tires squeal. His arms bulged as the car fought him. For an instant, he thought he&#x2019;d taken the corners too fast and that would be it. He threw his body weight behind his biceps and got his car around the last curve.</p><p>&#x201c;Stupid, stupid, stupid, C.J. What is your problem these days?&#x201d;</p><p>Then he remembered the car behind him. He glanced up. He saw twin headlights dashing wildly. Then he heard the horrible high-?�pitched whine of burning rubber spinning off the road.</p><p>&#x201c;Sweetheart, are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>The voice came from far away. She thought that was odd. She&#x2019;d been through this drill before, careering off a road in an Arizona night. There weren&#x2019;t other voices, anyone to offer assistance. There had only been her and the sound of the crickets mourning.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, come back to me. That&#x2019;s it, sweetheart. Draw a nice, deep breath of air.&#x201d;</p><p>She opened her eyes. The image took a while to gain substance and form. First the man was hazy; she&#x2019;d expected that. Maybe he&#x2019;d have wings and a halo&#x2014;?�who knew what angels really wore? He&#x2019;d be Shawn or her father. Longing welled up in her throat. Reality cut it back down.</p><p>This man wasn&#x2019;t Shawn. He was too filled out, with the broad shoulders of a man, not a boy. His fingers brushed her cheek, and they were callused.</p><p>Immediately, she stiffened. She was alive. She was conscious. She had better pull herself together.</p><p>&#x201c;Take it easy,&#x201d; the stranger murmured. &#x201c;I got you.&#x201d;</p><p>Arms curled around her, and hands fumbled with the seat belt still fastened at her waist. She tried to shrink back, but she couldn&#x2019;t seem to make her body work. She tried to speak, but no sound came out.</p><p>Abruptly, she was cradled against a hard chest and lifted into the night.</p><p>&#x201c;Here we go.&#x201d;</p><p>Her head lolled against his shoulder, and the world spun sickeningly. Cool, composed, always professional Tamara Allistair contemplated throwing up on a man she&#x2019;d never met. Oh, God.</p><p>&#x201c;Honey, we need to get you to a hospital. Lie down right&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; This time her throat cooperated. She repeated the word more sharply. She&#x2019;d spent two years in and out of hospitals and physical therapy departments. That was enough time in drafty gowns and sterile rooms for anyone.</p><p>&#x201c;Honey&#x2014;?�&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a moment of silence. She used it to try to calm her stomach and ...</p></p><h2>Four Views on Hell</h2><p><p>Most contemporary Christians acknowledge the doctrine of hell, but they&#x2019;d rather not think about how God punishes the wicked. The authors of Four Views on Hell meet this subject head-on with different views on what the Scriptures say. Is hell to be understood literally as a place of eternal smoke and flames? Or are such images simply metaphors for a real but different form of punishment? Is there such a thing as &#x201c;conditional immortality,&#x201d; in which God annihilates the souls of the wicked rather than punishing them endlessly? Is there a Purgatory, and if so, how does it fit into the picture? The interactive Counterpoints forum allows the reader to see the four views on hell&#x2014;literal, metaphorical, conditional, and purgatorial&#x2014;in interaction with each other. Each view in turn is presented, critiqued, and defended. This evenhanded approach is ideal for comparing and contrasting views in order to form a personal conclusion about one of Christianity&#x2019;s key doctrines. The Counterpoints series provides a forum for comparison and critique of different views on issues important to Christians. Counterpoints books address two categories: Church Life and Bible and Theology. Complete your library with other books in the Counterpoints series.</p></p><p>What do the Scriptures say hell is?

She is a certified marriage and family counselor, a Texas Tech graduate and writer-in-residence at West Texas A&amp;M University. She lives with her husband in Amarillo, Texas.<em>Crossroads, Texas</em><br><em>October</em><br><em>Angela</em><br><br>Dried weeds scratched against Angela Harold's bare legs as she walked the neglected grounds behind the Ransom Canyon Museum near Crossroads, Texas. Rumbling gray clouds spotted the sky above. Wind raged as though trying to push her back to the East Coast. She decided any rain might blow all the way to Oklahoma before it could land on Texas soil. But the weather didn't matter. She had made it here. She'd done exactly what her father told her. She'd vanished.<br><br>Angela had meant to stop long enough to clean up before she took her first look at the museum, but she could not wait. So, in sandals, shorts and a tank top, she explored the land behind the boarded-up building on the edge of Ransom Canyon.<br><br>When she'd talked to the board president, Staten Kirkland, five days ago, he'd sounded excited. They'd had to close the museum when the last curator left and in six months she'd been the only one to call about the job opening. Before the phone call ended Kirkland offered her a three-month trial if she could answer one question.<br><br>Angela thought it would be about her experience or her education, but it was pure Texas folk history.<br><br>"What or who was the Yellow Rose of Texas?" the man on the phone asked in his pure Texas twang.<br><br>She laughed. "The woman who entertained Santa Anna before the Battle of San Jacinto. The battle that won Texas independence." She'd always loved that story, which often got left out of history books.<br><br>"We'll be waiting for you, Mrs. Jones."<br><br>He hung up before she had time to tell him that her name wasn't Jones. In a moment of paranoia, she'd used a false name when she'd bought a laptop and phone. Then again on the application, figuring she'd be just one of hundreds who applied. Now, if he checked her transcripts or references, she'd have to make up another lie. That would be easier than finding some guy named Jones, marrying him and dragging him along to Texas with her.<br><br>Angela had driven a hundred miles before she decided she would tell Kirkland that she used Jones because she had been engaged but he left her at the altar. Kirkland would feel sorry for her, but that was better than killing off her imaginary husband.<br><br>She'd straighten it all out Monday. She'd even practice just how she'd say it.<br><br>Monday, she'd dress in a suit and accept the position as curator for the three-month trial period, but today simply exploring the place would be enough. After days in the car she needed to stretch her legs and breathe in the clean air. She'd dreamed of being in Texas for years. A wild country&#x2014;untamed, open, free. Something she'd never felt before, but she planned to now. For the first time, she was free to make her own future.<br><br>The grounds behind the museum had been left natural, just as it must have looked a hundred and fifty years ago when settlers came to this top square of Texas.<br><br>Since the day she'd read there was an opening here for a curator, Angela learned everything she could about this area. The history was interesting, but the people who founded this frontier town fascinated her. They were hearty. Stubborn. Independent. Honest. All things she'd never been. But the first settlers were also broken, desperate and lost. Somehow they'd managed to work together to build, not just ranches and a town, but a future.<br><br>Now she had to do the same with no family or friends to help her.<br><br>She didn't know if she belonged here. She fainted at the sight of blood. Gave in at the first sign of disagreement.<br><br>That left honest. She didn't want to even think about how dishonest she was. She'd lied to get the job as curator of this closed museum.<br><br>Standing near the edge of a canyon that dropped a hundred feet straight down, she let the sun's dying rays warm her face. Everything about her had to change. She had to make it so. She had to start over.<br><br>Somewhere along the road between Florida and here, she'd come to the conclusion that her father's death wasn't an accident. Maybe he knew something about the company or his brother. Maybe he'd overheard trouble moving in. Why else would he have told her to run? If her life weren't in danger, why would it be so important that she vanish?<br><br>Maybe he'd been planning to disappear with her, only time ran out for him. But he had left her prepared.<br><br>He'd put money in her account. He'd even suggested that she tell no one about this job in Texas.<br><br>The old trailer he bought and hid in the garage fit into the plan. Last month, he'd had her car fit with the hitch. She'd told him she had no need to pull a trailer, but he'd said that if he ever needed the trailer, he didn't want to use it on the company car he drove. Only, she'd been the one who needed the trailer. She'd done what he'd told her to do in the note and now she had to somehow blend in here in Texas.<br><br>Taking the curator job was the first step. This time her title didn't have "assistant" attached to it. She would be the boss. This time she would have no aunt to criticize every move she made.<br><br>Angela smiled. Her aunt had probably dropped by the beach house to have that talk with her by now. After all, it had been a week. She'd find the key in the mailbox. No note. No forwarding address. No friends notified. Any mail concerning her life on Anna Marie Island would be trashed.<br><br>Angela had even cancelled her cell phone service and tossed the phone off the Bradenton Bridge when she crossed onto the mainland.<br><br><em>Disappear,</em> her father's note had said. She'd seen enough spy movies to know what that meant.<br><br>She touched the necklace she wore. A replica of the Greek coin on display at her uncle's store. She'd thought of tossing it into the ocean with her phone, but decided it would always remind her of her father. The real one had caused many an argument between the brothers. Her father saw it as a family treasure. Uncle Anthony saw it as something to be sold to the highest bidder.<br><br>They'd compromised and made copies to sell for a few hundred dollars each.<br><br>Glancing toward the sound of crunching gravel, she watched a white-and-blue sheriff's car pull into the museum's parking lot. Her heart stopped.<br><br>Trouble had found her halfway across the country. Somehow her uncle had tracked her. But how? She'd parked her old car in a twenty-four-hour Walmart lot in Orlando and walked across the street to rent a pickup with a hitch for her trailer. Then she'd turned the pickup in before she crossed the Florida state line. She'd bought a junker of a car with cash but it wasn't powerful enough to pull the trailer, giving her nothing but trouble for two hundred miles. Two days later in Georgia she'd traded in the junker and her old two-wheel trailer to a mechanic for a van in a town too small to have a stop sign. The guy said he'd mail the title to the van, but she had given him a fake name and address.<br><br>What if the van had been stolen? The law could be about to arrest her, and she had no proof she bought the van.<br><br>Angela stared at the patrol car as it pulled in beside her van. Her freedom had lasted less then a week. Maybe her uncle had put out a missing person alert? That wouldn't surprise her. Her aunt probably told everyone Angela was so lost in grief she wasn't to be left alone.<br><br>A man in a uniform unfolded out of his car. She expected him to pull his gun as he walked toward her. After all, she'd run away from home at twenty-seven. Something all her relatives would swear quiet Angela would never do.<br><br>"Pardon me, miss," the man said as he neared. "This place has been closed for months. We got a no-trespassing sign at the turnoff, but you must have missed it."<br><br>In her shorts, no makeup and her strawberry-blond hair in a day-old ponytail, she must look more girl than woman. The echo of her mother's familiar speech about how Angela was too chubby, too squat to wear shorts, circled through her tired mind.<br><br>"I'm sorry. I didn't notice the sign." She straightened, trying to look at least five foot five, though she knew she missed her goal by two inches.<br><br>She moved toward the lawman trying her best to look like a professional. "I'm Angela&#x2014;"<br><br>Hesitating, she tried to remember the last name she'd used on the application. It slipped her mind completely. "Smith." Angela mentally shook her tired brain awake. <em>"Jones." Of course. How hard could that be to remember?</em><br><br>There, she'd gotten it out. After not talking for three days, words didn't want to form in her brain.<br><br>She stared at his name tag. Sheriff Brigman looked as if he easily read the lie that lay in her mind like oil slush. He pulled off his Stetson stalling for time, but she didn't miss the way he looked her up and down from ponytail to sandals.<br><br>"Welcome to town, Mrs. Jones. Kirkland told me you were coming."<br><br>A hint of a smile lifted the corner of his mouth. He reminded her of a sheriff from the Wild West days. Well built, a touch of gray in his sideburns and stone-cold eyes that said he'd finish the job, no matter what it took, whether it was catching the outlaw or satisfying his woman.<br><br>She mentally slapped herself. No time to flirt or daydream. Angela had to think of what to say. Was it too early to ask for a lawyer? Should she start confessing? But to what? She wasn't even sure what crimes she'd committed. Running away at her age didn't seem to be illegal, and she'd read somewhere that you can go by an alias if you were not doing anything wrong.<br><br>When she didn't offer any comment, the cop in the Stetson added, "My guess is you couldn't wait to see the inside of this place. Did you just get to town?"<br><br>She nodded, thankful he didn't add "Dressed like a fifteen-year-old." With luck, he hadn't noticed she couldn't remember her own name. Maybe he thought she had early onset Alzheimer's.<br><br>"Yes, sorry, I've been driving for twelve hours, so I'm a bit scattered. I wanted a quick look at the canyon before dark. It's beautiful out here near the edge."<br><br>Brigman nodded as he watched the last bit of sunlight running over the canyon walls turn the rocks gold. "I like to check on the museum this time of day. It kind of reminds me of a great painting. No matter what kind of day I've had, all is calm out here."<br><br>"I can see that." She'd feared she would miss the ocean and the beautiful sunsets at Anna Marie Island, but Ransom Canyon had its own kind of wonder. She had a feeling the canyon would grow on her.<br><br>"You know, Mrs. Jones, your office has a great view." He pointed to a huge window on the second floor of the big barn of a building.<br><br>Angela smiled. "No one told me that, or I might have driven all night."<br><br>They both started walking toward the parking lot.<br><br>"Your husband driving the moving van in?" Sheriff Brigman had an easy way of asking questions as if he were just being friendly.<br><br>"I'm not married," she said, then remembered the application listing her new name as Jones.<br><br>"When I interviewed over the phone with Mr. Kirkland, I was two days away from being married." She did her best to look brokenhearted, but it wasn't easy, since she'd never once given her heart away. "The night before the wedding, we called it off."<br><br>The sheriff studied her as if planning to wait for more information.<br><br>"We didn't work out. My fianc� didn't want to move." She shrugged as if fighting back tears. "When we broke up, I thought a clean getaway would be best, so I went ahead and came to Texas." Since <em>fianc�</em> Jones never existed, it wasn't really very painful to walk out on him. "I'd already changed my email and accounts over to Jones."<br><br>Brigman raised an eyebrow. "Are you planning to keep his name?"<br><br>Angela fought down a nervous giggle. "I'm sentimental about names. Turns out his name was the only thing I liked about the man. As soon as I settle, I'll change everything back. Of course, my driver's license is still in my maiden name." This whole thing was getting mixed up in her brain. At this point any way she could climb out of this little lie was probably going to end up making her look like an idiot.<br><br>Thank goodness they had reached her van. A few more lies and the sheriff would probably figure out she was on the run and have her arrested or committed.<br><br>"Have you been by your new house yet?" he asked as he opened her car door.<br><br>"Do you know where it is?" Mr. Kirkland had mentioned that he'd email her some information, but she'd forgotten to look.<br><br>"Sure." He grinned, looking younger. "This is a small town, Mrs. Jones, I mean..."<br><br>He waited for her to fill in the blank. "Harold," she answered.<br><br>The sheriff nodded once. "Kirkland said you wanted to rent a two-bedroom furnished place that allowed cats. Half the Chamber of Commerce started looking for something special. We don't get many professional curators around here. I could show you the one we picked for you and the runner-up, Miss Harold. I've got keys to both."<br><br>"Please call me Angela, Sheriff."<br><br>He touched two fingers to the brim of his Stetson in a salute. "All right, Angela. Why don't you call me Dan. Which do you want to see first, a nice little house between the two churches in town or a cabin house on the lake? The church house has more room, but the lake house backs into the shoreline."<br><br>"I'll take the lake house," she said immediately. She almost hugged him. <em>Water.</em> She'd be near water.<br><br>"Follow me, then."<br><br>"I don't want to be any trouble," she said. "If you'll give me the key, I can probably find it."<br><br>"No trouble. You have to pass my house at the lake to get to yours. Showing you the place isn't out of my way home at all."<br><br>As the sheriff's car led her through the small town of Crossroads, Angela fought down another wave of panic that seemed to be coming over her as often as hiccups. This open country where anyone could see for miles in every direction didn't seem like a very wise place to hide. Probably half the people in town would know where she lived.

It's true, you are the epitome of efficiency, meticulous systematization, and clarity. Your work environment and home reflect a sense of reasonable order. No clutter. No piles. A place for everything and everything in its place. You are the technique specialist and like to keep yourself up to date with the latest approaches to ensure that you are doing your job well. So join me as you learn how to maximize your strengths and shed some light on new and proven ways to generate more energy, develop more skills, and increase your personal success. Now, take a deep breath. For those of you who scored low in this section, you still use some of this type of methodical thinking for basic survival and efficiency. Although you may not feel comfortable using these skills for too long at a time, take solace in realizing that some of these techniques could give you a leg up, so it's a good idea to get to know this brain type. If a coworker, spouse, child, or friend is one of these amazing organizational types, reading this chapter will help you figure out what makes them tick and how you two can work better together. Okay, Maintaining Style, you tend to prefer having specific steps you can follow, right down to the letter. I assure you, a custom-mademethodology is coming! (Lots of bulleted points are right around the corner. You will be able to easily check them off, one by one, so you can incorporate them immediately into your daily routine.) However, let's first explore the way you do things, and see if we can better understand how you could manage your environment effectively. Relinquish a bit of control and let me support you. I know that that isn't your style. You prefer to have the directions, your car all tuned up, your lunch beside you, a map open, and know exactly what is expected of you once you arrive. Here is your agenda for this chapter: &#x2022; How your brain type works &#x2022; Why do you need help? &#x2022; How to manage your environment in your own style &#x2022; The details &#x2022; The strengths and challenges of your brain &#x2022; Organizing your time &#x2022; Organizing your home &#x2022; Organizing your office &#x2022; Conclusion &#x2022; Overview of the Maintaining Style I will help you set up a structure for organizing that will be easy for you to understand, maintain, and--most important--enjoy.

Ultimately, all of these insights and tools will strengthen your belief in your inherent talents. Even though you like to work alone, we will work together in dissecting some of your daily actions. This will give us insight into how you can shift your perception of what you are doing in order to achieve more ease and calm. This new relaxation will actually enhance your ability to achieve even more in a way that makes you feel confident and powerful. HOW YOUR BRAIN TYPE WORKS Order and simplification are the first steps toward the master of the subject. --Thomas Mann, <i>The Magic Mountain</i> &nbsp; <br> Your brain is blessed with the ability to understand work, activities, and life in general by following proven routines. With your linear, structured style, you focus on details and develop effective methods that allow you to manage tasks and complete assignments, checking them off one by one. Your work style isn't about speed, but reflects a methodical approach that usually requires uninterrupted time to get the job done. Being slow-paced, deliberate, and sequential, your brain type prefers doing things in a way that can appear to others as somewhat boring. But who cares, you do it right the first time and would rather take the time to be right than the first one done! Since you tend to be traditional and a somewhat conservative planner, you follow the rules. But that's your innate way, and it works just fine, combined with doing things in the same order, preferably at the same time of day. To you, routine is the proper and precise way to work. As you say, "If you are going to do it, do it right." Which way is right? Your way, of course! You prefer to classify information in either chronological or alphabetical order. You may even have your own organizational system that you've developed and always use. (For example, A, B, C ... 1, 2, 3 ... I, II, III ... . ) You then typically store that information in a neat and conscientious way--since you are the "maintainer of info"--that still provides you with easy, stress-free retrieval when it is urgently requested for a meeting. Being the implementer of planned agendas and guidance, you don't like to just wing it. That would feel very uncomfortable and may even cause you to panic. The tasks you need to perform on any given day are typically listed in your day planner. Being incredibly specific about your time commitments, even weekend time is included, and notes are structured in a step-by-step, timely fashion. You are able to schedule with accuracy,since you've done the same procedures a hundred times and know just how long they take. Uniformity brings you consistency and accuracy--time and time again. Where you feel most comfortable many others feel stifled, or uninspired. By doing what has been previously done, your brain finds comfort and success as you continually use proven techniques. Others see you as productive because you don't waste time trying to reinvent the wheel. You tend to work methodically and are very thorough in all that you do. You find it easier to begin a project when you know how it was done in the past. And depending on your sensory preference, you would either prefer to see it done (visual), read or hear about it (auditory), or participate in a hands-on demonstration (kinesthetic). The two biggest enemies to your comfort zone are interruption and surprise. As a result, change, in any shape or form, can cause stress and may even make you so confused that you find it difficult to get back on track. Your schedule may turn upside down if one thing gets out of place. In managing time, the crux of your dilemma is trying to complete tasks when things around you are hectic and present frequent interruptions. Take a deep breath. And then another. Remember, you are always willing to spend the time to get organized and that you are in control of your surroundings. New things and new approaches can cause you discomfort. You overcome your fear of change when you see that a new procedure has proven effective. It takes a lot for you to move into unknown territory. Therefore, when you are asked to do something new, you may want to ask specific questions that you have written down first. You need first to understand why you are doing it that way, process it, and then do it. You think before you move. That way you are able to gather your wits, get the details straight, and plan a face-to-face meeting. You receive recognition from your family or coworkers most often when you are able to integrate facts and figures with procedures that are already in place. By being able to report sequentially, in projects and correspondence, you can help your superiors "look good" at work. By maintaining and retrieving documents, you help them to make quick and accurate decisions. You offer good value wherever you go. Youmay not appear flashy, but you are the reliable behind-the-scenes person who systematizes routine tasks easily and effortlessly. You also tend to be the quintessential keeper of all the paperwork, facts, figures, and policies in your organization. Thank God, someone knows the rules! When in doubt or need of something, your coworkers or family members always ask you, "Where is the ... ?" And you always know! Your tax returns are filed on time; kids are picked up from school; and Christmas presents arrive before December 25. All of us owe a lot to you. Our world and families depend on you. When I lecture to various CEOs around the world, most of them crave working with someone like you, and other than their intimate partner, you may be the most important asset in their lives. WHY DO YOU NEED HELP? Never before have we had so little time in which to do so much. --Franklin D. Roosevelt &nbsp; <br> During the past few years, 60 percent of my clients have been people like you--people who are very well organized but who are very stressed out keeping it all together. We work side by side and enjoy the process of discussing organizational skills. When I work with the rest of my client base, it's a different story. They normally disappear the moment I arrive. They want me to "take care of it" and are unnerved by the process of organizing, period. Why do I work with your type the most? First, you are aware of the fact that so many people depend on you and you need to have everything in good order and easily accessible. Second, you, more than anyone, know the value of organizing, how beneficial it can be to your life, and are therefore willing to spend the time and the money to do it. Third, you are likely to stick to a new set of daily routines if they are explained to you and you see the value in them. You enjoy collecting the "right" supplies and ideas that make organizing work. Learning to maximize your unique organizing talents is the name of the game. Once in a while you may fall into the "working harder and not smarter" category. It's rare, but it happens. Sometimes false deadlines can be a strong motivator for you. This may be due to one of two issues that go hand-in-hand. You are either up against your "perfectionism" or "trying to keep it all together 24/7." Let's briefly examine these two points. First, perfection can be a wonderful motivational tool. But on the dark side it can kill you. Remember Marcy, the office manager at the production company in LA? She is one of the most cautious and deliberate people I have ever met. She knows details like no other--where every penny goes, where to find last year's launch campaign paraphernalia, and so on. She is the blood that runs through the company's veins. Her main organizing problem is that she must do things perfectly all of the time or she won't do them. If the label maker is broken, she won't even think about writing on a file folder tab with a marker (even though her handwriting was impeccable). She will wait until it is fixed and then work like a madwoman getting it all done. Since she doesn't trust anyone else to do the job and her standards are so over the top, she feels stressed most of the time. Even though she prefers to work her regular hours she will put in extra time, but preferably with advance notice, and will worry that it is all done correctly. Second, let's face it, you do receive enormous pressure from most people, at work and at home to keep it all organized and easier <i>for them</i>. It is important for you not to lower your standards even if you have to pick up all the DVDs and put them in order after the kids go to bed. You have to find a balance where things are easy enough to let other people assist you in maintaining your own impeccable standards. This is one of the ways that you can allow other people to contribute without your having to be 100 percent involved all of the time. HOW TO MANAGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT IN YOUR OWN STYLE Let all things be done decently and in order. --I Corinthians 14:4 &nbsp; <br> Yes, you can improve your already well organized office, home, closet, and car. You appreciate that it requires a lot of work to manage all of the tasks in your life from scheduling a tetanus shot for your daughter to finding the folder that your boss needs <i>now</i>. You are probably methodical and somewhat rigid in how you define your space. Storage, therefore, is key: how much to keep and easy access to it. This should be easy for you since you pretty much know where things are at all times anyway. It is just the bulk that is at issue. Remember, <i>your task is to enjoy organizing</i>--something that you do easily and so well. For you, the secret lies in maintenance. Below, you will find strategies you can modify depending on your lifestyle or what is expected of you in job-related tasks. Some things can be done weekly, monthly, or annually rather than daily. For example: daily--incoming mail; monthly--financial/bills; annually--reviewing personal files, bank statements, seasonal clothing, and so on. The process needs to be <i>practical</i> and uniform or you'll burn out in no time. Do what is easy for you, since you are probably going to be the only one maintaining a great deal of information. Some people may see you as a <i>neat freak</i>--everything lined up in order, linear and sequential. You prefer not to share equipment, files, etc., with other people if you can help it. At work it may be helpful to have a file card (an index card works well for this) for people to mark and put in the file drawer when they have removed a file. This can work well in situations that are very paper intensive, as at law firms or real estate offices. In a residential setting it may help to have specific rooms, cupboards, or drawers set up your way, even if that is different from your partner's. Just remember that for you, every object has a place and you may be the person who is expected to return things to their place at the end of the day. There is another important element that can support your unique organizing style: learning how to choose supplies and furniturethat make your life easier. You need no-nonsense solutions. Objects such as computer equipment, various pieces of furniture, storage pieces, and boxes must be practical and stored neatly and in order. Aesthetics are not a huge issue for you. Colorful supplies or snazy gadgets don't make that big of a difference for you. You can work almost anywhere and get the job done. What is crucial is that you must have easy access to the equipment and supplies you use every day. Another crucial point in designing a lifestyle that really works for you is time management. By having time to plan and set up a productive yet reasonable schedule, you will be able to institute step-by-step procedures that help you feel good at the end of the day. Spending the appropriate time to plan out your day will be extremely beneficial. With your reliability and follow-through, you may find some extra free time and maybe even take a break. THE DETAILS God is in the details. --Ludwig Mies van der Rohe &nbsp; <br> While the Innovating Style individual likes the big picture, you are all about the details. You tend to recall facts and figures easier than many others and as a result are able to cut through confusion and chaos time and time again. You look for errors all the time and prefer to give accurate and exact information. The more you approach your life in a detail-oriented fashion, the more likely you will feel that you can manage your surroundings effectively. People rely on you for specific answers, which you like to have at the drop of a hat. Labeling everything accurately, with no mistakes, is important so you can readily access those pieces of paper. Computer labeling or a label maker can help you. Marcy's labels are what most professional organizers want to see whe...</p><h2>Nasty Women: Feminism, Resistance, and Revolution in Trump&#39;s America</h2><p><p><b>Twenty-Three Leading Feminist Writers on Protest and Solidarity</b></p><p>When 53 percent of white women voted for Donald Trump and 94 percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton, how can women unite in Trump&#x2019;s America?

Unfortunately, what the book lacks in calories it more than makes up for in preparation time: Black Bean Soup, while flavorful, has 22 ingredients, with another seven required for the garnish; the Pinon-Crusted Chile Rellenos employ a staggering 37 ingredients. Not all dishes require that much measuring, chopping and dicing (she also offers suggestions for leftover chicken and salmon) but the prep time can be considerable, as can the shopping-virtually all the recipes employ a less-than-common ingredient such as key lime juice (which she uses like Emeril uses garlic), umeboshi pickled plum paste or Stevia extract.

Their extraordinary story [is told] in alternating first-person chapters that create suspense grim authenticity and impact. -Los Angeles Times &#34;This incredible true-life story is simply but compellingly written and so intriguing it has to be read in one sitting.&#34; -Booklist Hanna Bloch and Walter Kohner met in a small Czech town in 1935. She was fifteen, a romantic who planned to move to the big city. He was twenty and dreamed of being an actor. They ice skated; they danced; they hiked in the mountains; they fell in love. The political climate was rapidly changing and they had heard stories about the Nazis, but Hanna and Walter believed that Czechoslovakia was safe. They didn&#39;t realize just how invasive the Nazi command could be or how deeply it would change their lives. Eventually they fled. Walter immigrated to the United States and joined the U.S. military. Initially, Hanna worked in Amsterdam, but she was later rounded up by the Nazis and shuffled to four different concentration camps. Hanna and Walter not only preserves one couple&#39;s memories, but also delivers a powerful personal account of the Holocaust and its atrocities. And it serves as testament that love can prevail over seemingly impossible odds.</p><p>Hanna and Walter Kohner first met and fell in love in a small Czech town during the winter of 1935. Though the looming war in Europe caused them to separate, they never fell out of love with each other. Their story of love overcoming impossible odds was one of the few Holocaust stories with a happy ending. They spent the remainder of their lives in Los Angeles, where Walter was a well-known agent representing actors, authors and directors.Frederick Kohner, Walter?s brother, who helped edit this book, came to Los Angeles before the war.

Equally, Meade&#39;s Army of the Potomac needed to regain it&#39;s fighting credibility after the setbacks of Fredericksburg and saw this as an opportunity to redeem its honour.

DuBek was a passionate advocate and patron of the arts who felt that life and the body were to be celebrated; he had no patience for other people&#x2019;s attempts to make him feel guilty for his attractions and desires, nor any qualms about the different worlds in which he operated.

The <i>Dionysiaca</i>, in 48 books, has for its chief theme the expedition of Dionysus against the Indians; but the poet contrives to include all the adventures of the god (as well as much other mythological lore) in a narrative which begins with chaos in heaven and ends with the apotheosis of Ariadne's crown. The wild ecstasy inspired by the god is certainly reflected in the poet's style, which is baroque, extravagant, and unrestrained. It seems that Nonnos was in later years converted to Christianity, for in marked contrast to the <i>Dionysiaca</i>, a poem dealing unreservedly with classical myths and redolent of a pagan outlook, there is extant and ascribed to him a hexameter paraphrase of the Gospel of John.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of the <i>Dionysiaca</i> is in three volumes.</p></p><p><p>William Henry Denham Rouse (1863&#x2013;1950) was Headmaster of the Perse School and a founding editor of the Loeb Classical Library.</p></p><h2>Secret Fire</h2><p><p>A master storyteller who spins romantic fiction like not other, Johanna Lindsey weaves together endearing characters, enthralling adventure and pulsating passion to create stories that touch the hearts of her readers.</p> Secret Fire<p></p><p>He'd caught only a glimpse of her from the window of his carriage, but the young prince knew he had to have her.

That Christ is the Alpha and Omega&#x2014;the logic, the meaning of creation itself, from whom the drama of salvation emanates and toward whom it moves&#x2014;is a central but often neglected doctrine of Catholic Christianity. Though it is a mystery that will ever elude rational explication, sufficient traces of it can be found. Drawing primarily on the insights of Ren� Girard and Hans Urs von Balthasar, Gil Bailie&#x2019;s new book is a work of reconnaissance, an effort to locate and explicate some of these traces.

Tracing their fates, Nicholson shows that these women did indeed harbor secret sadness, and many of them yearned for the comforts forever denied them--physical intimacy, the closeness of a loving relationship, and children. Some just endured, but others challenged the conventions, fought the system, and found fulfillment outside of marriage. From the mill-girl turned activist to the debutante turned archeologist, from the first woman stockbroker to the "business girls" and the Miss Jean Brodies, this book memorializes a generation of young women who were forced, by four of the bloodiest years in human history, to stop depending on men for their income, their identity, and their future happiness. Indeed, <em>Singled Out</em> pays homage to this remarkable generation of women who, changed by war, in turn would change society.<br></p><p><br><strong>Virginia Nicholson</strong> studied at Cambridge University and lived in France and Italy, then worked as a documentary researcher for BBC Television.

Where the breakers crash and the salt water whirls, that is where the place that is ours rises from the sea. The legacy that passes from father to son.&nbsp;<br>LENNART ALBINSSON--R�DMANS�<b>The sea has given and the sea has taken away</b>Who flies there in the feather-harbour, who climbs up there out of the black, shining waters?&nbsp;<br>GUNNAR EKEL�F--TJ�RVEN<b>Sea buckthorn</b><i>Three thousand years ago, Domar� was nothing but a large, flat rock sticking up out of the water, crowned by an erratic boulder the ice had left behind. One nautical mile to the east it was possible to glimpse the round shape that would later rise out of the sea and be given the name G�vasten. Apart from that, there was nothing. It would be another thousand years before the surrounding islets and islands dared to poke their heads above the water, beginning the formation of the archipelago that goes under the name of Domar� archipelago today.</i><i>By that time the sea buckthorn had already arrived on Domar�.</i><i>Down below the enormous block left by the ice, a shoreline had formed. There in the scree the sea buckthorn worked its way along with its creeping roots, the hardy shrub finding nourishment in the rotting seaweed, growing where there was nothing to grow in, clinging to the rocks. Sea buckthorn. Toughest of the tough.</i><i>And the sea buckthorn produced new roots, crept up over thewater's edge and grew on the slopes until a metallic-green border surrounded the uninhabited shores of Domar� like a fringe. Birds snatched the fiery yellow berries that tasted of bitter oranges and flew with them to other islands, spreading the gospel of the sea buckthorn to new shores, and within a few hundred years the green fringe could be seen in all directions.</i><i>But the sea buckthorn was preparing its own destruction.</i><i>The humus formed by its rotting leaves was richer than anything the stony shores could offer, and the alder saw its chance. It set its seeds in the mulch left by the sea buckthorn, and it grew stronger and stronger. The sea buckthorn was unable to tolerate either the nitrogen-rich soil produced by the alder, or the shade from its leaves, and it withdrew down towards the water.</i><i>With the alder came other plants that needed a higher level of nutrition, competing for the available space. The sea buckthorn was relegated to a shoreline that grew far too slowly, just half a metre in a hundred years. Despite the fact that it had given birth to the other plants, the sea buckthorn was displaced and set aside.</i><i>And so it sits there at the edge of the shore, biding its time. Beneath the slender, silky green leaves there are thorns. Big thorns.</i><b>Two small people and a large rock (July 1984)</b>They were holding hands.He was thirteen and she was twelve. If anyone in the gang caught sight of them, they would just die right there on the spot. They crept through the fir trees, alert to every sound and every movement as if they were on some secret mission. In a way they were: they were going to be together, but they didn't know that yet.It was almost ten o'clock at night, but there was still enough light in the sky for them to see each other's arms and legs as pale movements over the carpet of grass and earth still holding the warmthof the day. They didn't dare look at each other's faces. If they did, something would have to be said, and there were no words.They had decided to go up to the rock. A little way along the track between the fir trees their hands had brushed against each other's, and one of them had taken hold, and that was it. Now they were holding hands. If anything was said, something straightforward would become difficult.Anders' skin felt as if he had been out in the sun all day. It was hot and painful all over, and he felt dizzy, as if he had sunstroke; he was afraid of tripping over a root, afraid of his hand becoming sweaty, afraid that what he was doing was <i>out of order</i> in some way.There were couples in the gang. Martin and Malin were together now. Malin had gone out with Joel for a while. It was OK for them to lie there kissing when everybody could see them, and Martin said he and Malin had got as far as petting down by the boathouses. Whether or not it was true, it was OK for them to say--and do--that kind of thing. Partly because they were a year older, partly because they were good-looking. Cool. It gave them licence to do a lot of things, and to use a different language too. There was no point in trying to keep up, that would be embarrassing. You just had to sit there staring, trying to laugh in the right places. That's just how it was.Neither Anders nor Cecilia was a loser. They weren't outsiders like Henrik and Bj�rn--Hubba and Bubba--but they weren't part of the clique that made the rules and decided which jokes were funny, either.For Anders and Cecilia to be walking along holding hands was utterly ridiculous. They knew this. Anders was short and borderline spindly, his brown hair too thin for him to give it any kind of style. He didn't understand how Martin and Joel did it. He'd tried slicking his hair back with gel once, but it looked weird and he'd rinsed it out before anyone saw it.There was something flat about Cecilia. Her body was angular and her shoulders were broad, despite the fact that she was slim. Virtually no hips or breasts. Her face looked small between thosebroad shoulders. She had medium-length fair hair and an unusually small nose dusted with freckles. When she put her hair up in a ponytail, Anders thought she looked really pretty. Her blue eyes always looked just a little bit sad, and Anders liked that. She looked as if she knew.Martin and Joel didn't know. Malin and Elin didn't know. They had the feeling, said the right things and were able to wear sandals without looking stupid. But they didn't know. They just did things. Sandra read books and was clever, but there was nothing in her eyes to indicate that she knew.Cecilia knew, and Anders could see that she knew, which proved that he knew as well. They recognised one another. He couldn't explain what it <i>was</i> that they knew, but it was something. Something about life, about how things really were.The terrain grew steeper, and as they made their way up towards the rock the trees thinned out. In a minute or two they would have to let go of one another's hands so they'd be able to climb.Anders stole a glance at Cecilia. She was wearing a yellow and white striped T-shirt with a wide neckline that revealed her collarbone. It was just unbelievable that she had been linked to him for what must be five minutes, that her skin had been touching his.<i>That she'd been his.</i>She had been his for five minutes. Soon they would let go, move apart and become ordinary people again. What would they say then?Anders looked down. The ground was starting to become stony, he had to watch where he was putting his feet. Every second he was expecting Cecilia to let go, but she didn't. He thought perhaps he was holding on so tightly that she <i>couldn't</i> let go. It was an embarrassing thought, so he loosened his grip slightly. Then she let go.He spent the two minutes it took to climb up the rock analysing whether he had, in fact, been holding her hand too tightly, or whether loosening his grip had made her think <i>he</i> was about to let go, and so she let go first.Regardless of what he knew or did not know, he was convincedthat Joel and Martin never had this kind of problem. He wiped his hand furtively on his trousers. It was slightly stiff and sweaty.When they reached the top of the rock, his head felt bigger than usual. The blood was humming in his ears and he was sure his face was bright red. He stared down at his chest where a little ghost looked out from a circle with a red line through it. <i>Ghostbusters</i>. It was his favourite top, and it had been washed so many times that the outline of the ghost was becoming blurred.'It's so beautiful.'Cecilia was standing at the edge of the rock looking out over the sea. They were up above the tops of the trees. Far below they could see the holiday village where almost all their friends lived. Out at sea the ferry to Finland was sailing along, a cluster of lights moving across the water. Further away and further out there were other archipelagos whose names Anders didn't know.He stood as close to her as he dared and said, 'I think it's the most beautiful thing in the world,' and regretted it as soon as the words were out of his mouth. It was a stupid thing to say, and he tried to improve matters by adding, 'That's one way of looking at it', but that wasn't right either. He moved away from her, following the edge of the rock.When he had walked all the way round, a distance of perhaps thirty metres, and was almost back with her, she said, 'It's odd, isn't it? This rock, I mean?'He had an answer to that. 'It's an erratic boulder. According to my dad, anyway.''What's that?'He gazed out across the sea, fixed his eyes on the G�vasten lighthouse and tried to remember what his father had told him. Anders made a sweeping movement with his arm, taking in the surrounding area. The old village, the mission, the alarm bell next to the shop.'Well...when there was ice. Covering everything here. The ice age. The ice picked up rocks. And when it melted, these rocks ended up all over the place.''So where did they come from? Originally?'His father had told him that as well, but he couldn't remember what he'd said. Where could the stones hav...</p><h2>The Old House Handbook: The Essential Guide to Care and Repair</h2><p><p>Here, for the first time, is a completely authoritative guide on how to look after your old house - whether it's a timber framed medieval cottage, an eighteenth century urban terrace or an example of Victorian or Edwardian speculative development.�<br> <br> Taking their lead from the conservation approach of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (who have approved and authorised this volume), the approach is one of respect, restraint and repair rather than 'restoration' which can so easily and permanently destroy the rich historical legacy of any old building.</p><p>This book provides richly and deeply informed practical guidance, with sections including:</p><ul><li>Breathability and Damp</li><li>Structural Movement</li><li>Roofs</li><li>Timber and Carpentry</li><li>Windows Doors and joinery.</li></ul><p>It will be essential reading for anyone with an old house in need of any kind of repair or maintenance.</p><p><strong>`For any of us working on or living in old buildings, this brilliant and properly illustrated volume is the manual we've been waiting for.

It is a story fueled on pot fumes and blues, borrowing and distorting the rigid conventions of the traditional western. Indians, cowboys, and outlaws are as interchangeable as their outfits; men strike poses from <i>Gunsmoke,</i> and horses are traded for Trans-Ams. Pidgin, the half-blood protagonist, inhabits a world of illusion&#x2014;of aliens, ghosts, telekinesis, and water-pistol violence&#x2014;where television offers redemption, and "the Indian always gets it up the ass."<br><br><p>Having escaped the porn factories of Utah, Pidgin heads for Clovis, NM to bury his father, Cline. But the body is stolen at the funeral, and Pidgin must recover it. With the aid of car thief Charlie Ward, he criscrosses a wasted New Mexico, straying through bars, junkyards, and rodeos, evading the cops, and tearing through barriers "Dukestyle." "Charlie Ward slid his thin leather belt from his jeans and held it out the window, whipping the cutlass faster, faster, his dyed black hair unbraiding in the fifty mile per hour wind, and they never stopped for gas." Along the way, Pidgin escapes a giant coyote, survives a showdown with Custer, and encounters the remnants of the Goliard Tribe&#x2014;a group of radicals to which Cline belonged.<br></p><p>Pidgin's search allows him to reconcile the death of his father with five hundred years of colonial myth-making, and will eventually place him in a position to rewrite history. Jones tells his tale in lean, poetic prose. He paints a bleak, fever-burnt west&#x2014;a land of strip-joints, strip-malls, and all you can eat beef-fed-beef stalls, where the inhabitants speak a raw, disposable lingo. His vision is dark yet frighteningly recognizable. In the tradition of Gerald Vizenor's Griever, <i>The Fast Red Road&#x2014;A Plainsong</i> blazes a trail through the puppets and mirrors of myth, meeting the unexpected at every turn, and proving that the past&#x2014;the texture of the road&#x2014;can and must be changed.</p></p><p><p>Stephen Graham Jones is an assistant professor of English at Texas Tech University.

He is a Fellow of the British Psychological Society (BPS), Founder Chair of the BPS Transpersonal Psychology Section, Past President and current Vice President of the Society for Psychical Research, and Chair of the SPR Survival Research Committee. He is Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Cardiff University, and Professor of Transpersonal Psychology at Liverpool John Moores University. His many books on spiritual themes, which have been translated into 25 languages, include The Secret Language of Symbols, The Secret Language of Dreams, Learn to Meditate, Learn Zen Meditation (all Duncan Baird/Chronicle), The Meditators Handbook, Teaching Meditation to Children (Thorsons), and Psychology, Religion and Spirituality (Blackwells). He lives near Cardiff, Wales.Is death the end of this existence, as some scientists seem to assume? Fontana, a British psychologist and fellow at Cardiff University, thinks not. In this manual, he marshals studies and other evidence to demonstrate the persistence of unexplained phenomena that point to the likelihood of life after death. In systematic fashion, Fontana plows through chapters on parapsychology; apparitions and visions of ghosts; hauntings (where apparitions are seen by more than one person in the same place over a long, continuous period); the history and nature of mediumship; different kinds of mediums; electronic voice phenomena; near-death experiences; out-of-body experiences; and reincarnation. Throughout, he includes case studies of alleged paranormal events from around the world, and also describes some of his own experiences, including a local Cardiff poltergeist he investigated from 1989 to 1992, and a medium who seems to have communicated with Fontana's deceased mother. It's clear that Fontana believes that many claims to the paranormal are true and that they provide credible evidence that a soul or spirit survives beyond physical death. Still, his tone is a bit more balanced than other paranormal apologetic texts. The book is indeed "comprehensive," as the subtitle indicates, and it is organized well enough that readers can easily skip to the chapters or sections that interest them rather than slogging through each chapter sequentially, since the writing can be overly detailed. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Or that it&#x2019;s sold on the Internet for 262 times the price of oil? Feted and fetishized, the breast is an evolutionary masterpiece. But in the modern world, the breast is changing. Breasts are getting bigger, arriving earlier, and attracting newfangled chemicals. Increasingly, the odds are stacked against us in the struggle with breast cancer, even among men. What makes breasts so mercurial&#x2015;and so vulnerable?<br><br> In this informative and highly entertaining account, intrepid science reporter Florence Williams sets out to uncover the latest scientific findings from the fields of anthropology, biology, and medicine. Her investigation follows the life cycle of the breast from puberty to pregnancy to menopause, taking her from a plastic surgeon&#x2019;s office where she learns about the importance of cup size in Texas to the laboratory where she discovers the presence of environmental toxins in her own breast milk. The result is a fascinating exploration of where breasts came from, where they have ended up, and what we can do to save them. 12 illustrations</p><p>Florence Williams is a journalist and contributing editor to Outside magazine.

Speaking a mystifying array of languages and lugging outdated weapons, the Austrian troops were hopelessly unprepared for the industrialized warfare that would shortly consume Europe.<br><br>As prizewinning historian Geoffrey Wawro explains in <i>A Mad Catastrophe</i>, the doomed Austrian conscripts were an unfortunate microcosm of the Austro-Hungarian Empire itself-both equally ripe for destruction. After the assassination of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914, Germany goaded the Empire into a war with Russia and Serbia. With the Germans massing their forces in the west to engage the French and the British, everything-the course of the war and the fate of empires and alliances from Constantinople to London-hinged on the Habsburgs' ability to crush Serbia and keep the Russians at bay. However, Austria-Hungary had been rotting from within for years, hollowed out by repression, cynicism, and corruption at the highest levels. Commanded by a dying emperor, Franz Joseph I, and a querulous celebrity general, Conrad von H�tzendorf, the Austro-Hungarians managed to bungle everything: their ultimatum to the Serbs, their declarations of war, their mobilization, and the pivotal battles in Galicia and Serbia. By the end of 1914, the Habsburg army lay in ruins and the outcome of the war seemed all but decided. <br><br>Drawing on deep archival research, Wawro charts the decline of the Empire before the war and reconstructs the great battles in the east and the Balkans in thrilling and tragic detail. <i>A Mad Catastrophe</i> is a riveting account of a neglected face of World War I, revealing how a once-mighty empire collapsed in the trenches of Serbia and the Eastern Front, changing the course of European history.<br><br></p><p><b>Geoffrey Wawro</b> studied at Brown and Yale and is Professor of History and Director of the Military History Center at the University of North Texas. The author of five books, including <i>Quicksand</i> and <i>The Franco-Prussian War</i>, Wawro lives in Dallas, Texas."Exceptionally accessible to the general reader, Wawro offers a picture of an Austro-Hungarian leadership that was reckless in the extreme...with a fatalistic sense of 'now or never.'" &#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>A Mad Catastrophe</i> finally brings some clarity to how the death of one Archduke, while admittedly tragic, could lead to the deaths of millions.... Wawro's excellently written book, in chilling detail, explains all the frustrating and infuriating blundering. The war was completely senseless, the insane war-lust of a failing state; this book gives Austria-Hungary its rightful, starring role as cause of the conflict." &#x2015;<b><i><b><i>San Francisco Book Review</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Wawro writes about the Austro-Hungarian Empire's role in the start and unfolding of the Great War with verve, inescapable black humour and a certain note of there-but-for-the-grace-of-God."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Macleans</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Wawro is a historian of the US military, but his damning portrait of the neurotic empire...well reflects the surreal fiction of Hasek and Musil."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Literary Review</i>, UK</b></i></b><br><br>"<i>A Mad Catastrophe</i> is a welcome contribution to the small but growing number of scholarly studies of the eastern front that have appeared in English over the last few years."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>BBC History Magazine</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In a year glutted with first world war books, this study stands out for its devastating portrayal of the reckless diplomacy, internal political disarray and incompetent battlefield leadership that dragged Austro-Hungary towards the abyss in 1914.

It is an evocative, emotionally charged story of a young life steeped in paradox; of a middle-class Parsi girl attending Catholic school in a predominantly Hindu city; of a guilt-ridden stranger in her own land, an affluent child in a country mired in abysmal poverty. She reveals intimate secrets and offers an unflinching look at family issues once considered unspeakable as she interweaves two fascinating coming-of-age stories&#x2014;one of a small child, and one of a nation.</p></p><p><p>Thrity Umrigar<strong> </strong>is the author of seven novels <em>Everybody&#x2019;s Son</em>, <em>The Story Hour</em>, <em>The World We Found</em>, <em>The Weight of Heaven</em>, <em>The Space Between Us</em>, <em>If Today Be Sweet</em>, and <em>Bombay Time</em>; a memoir, <em>First Darling of the Morning</em>; and a children&#x2019;s picture book, <em>When I Carried You in My Belly</em>.

A professor of English at Case Western Reserve University, she lives in Cleveland, Ohio.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>*Starred Review* A melancholy mood suffuses Indian author Umrigar&#x2019;s eloquent coming-of-age memoir (after If Today Be Sweet, 2007). Born in Bombay to middle-class Parsi parents, smart, precocious Umrigar spent much of her childhood feeling out of place. She was very close to her gentle father and her beloved aunt, but her mother was menacing and cruel, frequently mocking her and beating her with a switch. Umrigar&#x2019;s life changed when she met Jesse, a forward-thinking&#x2014;and rebellious&#x2014;young woman five years her senior, who introduced her to the wonders of literature and art. Umrigar soaked it all in, even shunning her family&#x2019;s privileged existence after reading Irving Stone&#x2019;s Lust for Life (1934), a novel based on the life of Vincent Van Gogh. Umrigar&#x2019;s upbringing in an apolitical family left her unprepared for the passion she felt after participating in a demonstration against the government. A sense of restlessness, combined with relentless family discord, fed her desire to escape to the U.S. The memoir ends with Umrigar at 21, departing for America, where she now works as a journalist and associate professor of English at Case Western Reserve University. But she has never forgotten her native land, brilliantly rendered in three critically acclaimed novels and now in this latest bracingly honest and bittersweet memoir. --Allison Block</p><h2>Exploring the Gospel of Mark (John Phillips Commentary Series)</h2><p>"John Phillips writes with enthusiasm and clarity, . . . cutting through the confusion and heretical dangers associated with Bible interpretation." &#x2014;<em>Moody</em> Magazine</p><p>John Phillips (1927-2010) served as assistant director of the Moody Correspondence School as well as director of the Emmaus Correspondence School, one of the world&#x2019;s largest Bible correspondence ministries.

But in the video store, on the other hand, they always ask if I want a bag, and even though, theoretically, I should be able to carry my DVD without a bag, and the bag is another waste of plastic, I always need a bag at the video store because, for reasons that will soon be understood, I believe all DVDs should be sheathed.<br><br>The camouflage doesn't work today. I'm only half a block out of the store when I see Ronald, the rice-haired Milquetoast who works at the coffee shop around the corner, approaching. "Hey, Carrie," he says, looking down at my DVD. "What'd you get?"<br><br>Uh-oh. I have to give this speech again.<br><br>"I can't tell you," I say, "and there's a reason I can't. Someday, I might want to rent something embarrassing, and I don't necessarily mean porn. It could be a movie that's considered too childish for my age or something violent or maybe Nazi propaganda&#x2014;for research purposes, of course&#x2014;and even though the movie I have in my hand is considered a classic, and nothing to be ashamed of, if I show it to you this time but next time I can't, then you'll know for sure that I'm hiding something next time. But if I never tell you what I've rented, it puts enough doubt in your mind that I'm hiding something, so I can feel free to rent porn or cartoons or fascist propaganda or whatever I want without fear of having to reveal what I've rented. The same goes for what I'm reading. I want to be able to pick a mindless novel, as well as Dostoyevsky And I also want to be able to choose something no one's heard of. Most of the time, people say, 'What are you reading?' and if I tell them the name of the book and it's not Moby Dick, they've never heard of it so I have to give an explanation, and if the book's any good it's not something I can explain in two seconds, so I'm stuck giving a twenty-five-page dissertation and by the time I'm done I have no time to finish reading. So books I read and movies I rent are off-limits for discussion. It's nothing personal."<br><br>Ronald stands there blinking for a second, then leaves.<br><br>My rules make perfect sense to me, but people find them strange. Still, I need them to survive. This world isn't one I understand completely, and it doesn't understand me completely, either. People think I'm odd for a nineteen-year-old girl&#x2014;or woman, if you're technical&#x2014;that I neither act excessively young nor excessively "girlish."<br><br>In truth, I feel asexual a lot of the time, like a walking brain with glasses and long dark hair and a mouth in good working order. If we were to talk about sex as in sex, as opposed to gender&#x2014;as everyone seems to want to these days&#x2014;I would say that my mind's not on sex that much, and I was never boy-crazy when I was younger. Which makes me different from just about everyone. I did have crushes on two of my professors in college, one of which actually turned into something, but that's a story for later on. That whole saga only confused me in the end. So much of the world is sex-obsessed that it takes someone practically asexual to realize just how extreme and pervasive it is. It's the main motivator of people's activities, the pith of their jokes and the driving force behind their art, and if you don't have the same level of drive, you almost question whether you should exist. If it's sex that makes the world go around, should the world stop for those of us who are asexual?<br><br>I graduated from college a year ago, three years ahead of my peers, and now I spend most of my time inside my apartment in the city. My father pays my rent. I could leave the house more, and I could even get a job, but I don't have much motivation to. My father would like me to work, but he has no right to complain. I remind him that it was his idea to skip me three grades in grammar school, forever putting me at the top of my class academically, in the bottom fifth heightwise, and in the bottom twenty-second socially.<br><br>My father is also the one who told me what I refer to as the Big Lie. But that, like all the business with my professor, is a story for later on.<br><br>When I get back to my apartment building, Bobby, the superintendent, asks how I'm doing, then takes the opportunity to stare at my rear end. I ignore him and climb the front steps. Bobby's always staring at my rear end. He is also too old to be named Bobby. There are some names that a person should retire after age twelve. Sally, for example. If Sally is your name, you should have it changed upon reaching puberty. Grown men should not be called Joey, Bobby, Billy, Jamie or Jimmy They can be Harry until the age of ten and after fifty, but not between. They can be Mike, Joe and Jim all their lives. They cannot be Bob during their teenage years. They can be Stuart, Stefan or Jonathan if they're gay. Christian is not acceptable for Jews. Moishe is not acceptable for Christians. Herbert is not acceptable for anyone. Buddy is good for a beagle. Matt is good for a flat piece of rubber. Fox is good for a fox. Dylan is too trendy.<br><br>I get in through the front door and the stairwell door and the apartment door. When I am finally inside, I experience tremendous afterglow. They make the apartments in New York as hard to get into as Tylenol bottles and almost as big.<br><br>I see a therapist, Dr. Petrov, once a week. He and my father grew up in London together. I don't really need to see him, but I go each week because I might as well get my father's money's worth.<br><br>The morning after I rent the DVD, I leave my apartment to see Petrov. It's drizzling softly outside. The air, a soupy mess, scrubs my cheeks, and the few remaining leaves on the trees bend under the weight of raindrops and dive to their deaths. A pothole in front of my building catches them, emitting a soggy symphony.<br><br>There's something I love about visiting Petrov: His building is on one of those quaint little blocks that almost make you forget how seedy other parts of New York can be. Both sides are lined with stately brownstones whose bright painted shutters flank lively flower boxes, the tendrils dripping down and hooking around wires and trellises. The signs on the sidewalk are extremely polite: Please Curb Your Dog; $500 Fine For Noise Here. It's idyllic and lovely. But the only people who get to live here are the folks who inherited these rent-controlled apartments from their rich old grandmas who wore tons of jewelry and played tennis with Robert Moses.<br><br>Petrov's waiting room is like a cozy living room, with a gold-colored trodden carpet and regal-footed chairs. One wall is lined with classic novels, a pointless feature since one does not have the time to read Ulysses while waiting for a doctor's appointment. A person would have to make more than 300 visits to Petrov in order to finish the book, which just proves that someone would have to be crazy to read all of Ulysses. But a waiting room is not the proper place or situation to read any book. All books have a time and a place. Anything by Henry Miller, for instance, should be read where no one can see you. Carson McCullers should be read in your window on a hot summer night. Sylvia Plath should be read if you're ready to commit suicide or want people to think you're really close.<br><br>On Petrov's coffee table, there's more literature: the L.L. Bean catalogue, Psychology Today, the Eddie Bauer catalogue, the Pfizer annual stockholders' report. I admire Petrov's ability to incorporate his junk mail into his profession.<br><br>The door to Petrov's office opens, and a short guy walks out, lowering his eyes as he hurries past me. No one I've ever passed coming into this office has made eye contact with me, as if it's embarrassing to be caught coming from a therapy appointment by someone who is about to do exactly the same thing.<br><br>Petrov stands in his doorway. "How are you doing today, Carrie?" he asks, waving me inside. There are books piled high on his desk and diplomas on the wall. Petrov sits down in a red chair and balances a yellow legal pad on his knee. I sink into the reclining chair opposite him.<br><br>"I'm fine."<br><br>"Did you make any new friends this week?"<br><br>I think my father put this theme into his head. I don't have many friends, but there's a good reason for this, which I'll explain in the near future.<br><br>"It rained this week," I tell him, "so mostly I stayed inside."<br><br>Petrov's hand flutters across the page. What could he be writing? It did rain all week.<br><br>"So you haven't been outside your apartment much. What about this coming week? Do you have any social plans?"<br><br>"I have a job interview today," I say. "Right after this appointment."<br><br>"That's wonderful!" he says. "What kind of job?"<br><br>"I don't know," I say. "The interview's with some guy my dad knows. I'm sure it'll be mindless and pointless."<br><br>"Perhaps by going in thinking that, you'll cause it to be so."<br><br>"If you're trying to say it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, that's psychobabble," I say. "If I tell you that the job might turn out to be mindless, then it might, or it might not. The outcome really has no relationship to whether I've said it."<br><br>"It might," Petrov says. "You put the suggestion out there." He leans back in his chair. "I think you often thwart yourself. Let's look at how you do it with friendships. Whenever you have met someone, you then tell me that the person was unintelligent or a hypocrite. Perhaps you have too narrow a definition of smart or too wide a one for hypocrite. There are some people who are very street-smart."<br><br>"You can't have an intelligent discussion with street smarts," I say. "And even if I could find other people who are smart, they'd probably still be hypocritical and dishonest."<br><br>It's true. I went to college with a lot of supposedly smart people, and they'd rationalize the stupid, dangerous or hypocritical things they did all the time: getting drunk, having sex with lots of different people, trying drugs. Nobody did any of that in the beginning of school, but once the temptation started, my classmates got sucked in, then began making excuses for it. Even the self-possessed religious kids came up with ridiculous rationalizations. If they want to believe in certain things, fine, and if they don't want to, that's fine, too, but they shouldn't lie to themselves about their reasons for changing their minds. The hypocrisy isn't any better out of school, especially in the city.<br><br>"I want you to tell me something positive right now," Petrov says. "About anything. Tell me something you love. As in, 'I love a sunset.' 'I love Miami Beach.'"<br><br>"I love it when people sound like Hallmark cards."<br><br>Petrov sighs. "Try harder."<br><br>"Okay." I think about it a bit. "I love peace and quiet."<br><br>He looks at me. "Go on."<br><br>"I guess you missed the point."<br><br>He sighs again. "Give me another example."<br><br>"I love...when I can just stretch out in my bed, hearing no horns, no chatter, no TV, nothing but the buzz of the electrical wiring in the wall. But sometimes I like the sounds from the street."<br><br>"I like that," Petrov says. "Now, tell me something that makes you sad. Something besides hypocrites and people who aren't smart. Tell me about a time recently when you cried."<br><br>I think. "I haven't cried in a long time."<br><br>"I know."<br><br>I hate when Petrov thinks he knows things about me without my telling him. "How do you know?"<br><br>"Because you're guarded. Because you were put into college at fifteen, when everyone was three to seven years older than you, and at fifteen, you weren't socially advanced or sexually aware. All kinds of behavior goes on at college, people drinking, losing their virginity right and left, experimenting with who knows what. Some people respond by trying to fit in, but you chose to opt out of the system completely. Which was understandable. But now, you've been out of college a year and you're still not experienced in adjusting to social changes. Being smart doesn't mean being skilled at social interaction. No one ever said being a genius was easy."<br><br>I hear it start to rain harder outside. Petrov gets up, shuts the window and sits back down.<br><br>"You've mentioned your father's Big Lie a few times," he says. "I think we should talk about that sometime."<br><br>"Yes&#x2014;"<br><br>"But not today. I have an assignment for you."<br><br>I look at the rug. It's full of tiny ropes and filaments.<br><br>"I want you to, just for a little while, be a little more social. Just to see the other side of it, to determine if there is such thing as a comfortable middle ground. I don't want you to do anything dangerous or immoral, but I want you to do things like go to a party, join an organization or club. After you do some of these things, I want you to tell me how you felt doing them. You don't have to start right away. You can wait a bit until you feel comfortable."<br><br>"Okay. How about next year?"<br><br>Petrov smiles. "That's not a bad idea," he says. "New Year's Eve would be a good night for you to spend time with friends. You could go to a New Year's Eve party."<br><br>"Maybe I should just vomit on Times Square," I say. "Then I'd be fitting in."<br><br>Petrov shakes his head. "You know I'm not suggesting you do anything dangerous. But I do want you to learn to socialize better. What you should do is work up to spending New Year's Eve with people. We'll start small first. A five-point plan."<br><br>Petrov grabs a memo cube that has Zoloft embossed at the top. Some people will take anything if it's free.<br><br>"First," he says, "I want you to write a list for me of ten things you love. The street sounds were a good start, but I want ten of them. Secondly, I want you to join at least one organization or club. That way, you might meet some people with similar interests, maybe even people you think are smart." He's writing this down. "Third, go on a date..."<br><br>"Okay..."<br><br></p><h2>The Earliest Christian Hymnbook: The Odes of Solomon</h2><p>That the earliest followers of Jesus wrote poetry, hymns, and odes is evident already in the New Testament.

In this stunning new account of their marriage, Diane Middlebrook draws on a trove of newly available papers to craft a beautifully written portrait of Hughes as a man, as a poet, and as a husband haunted&#x2014;and nourished&#x2014;his entire life by his relationship to Sylvia Plath.<p><i>Her Husband</i> is a triumph of the biographer's art and an up-close look at a couple who saw each other as the means to becoming who they wanted to be: writers and mythic representations of a whole generation.</p><p><br><br></p></p><p>Diane Middlebrook is the author of two highly praised, bestselling biographies, <b>Suits Me: The Double Life of Billy Tipton</b> and <b>Anne Sexton: A Biography</b>, which was a National Book Award and was a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist.Becoming Her Husband<p>Ted Hughes met Sylvia Plath at a wild party in February 1956 and married her four months later. He was English, twenty-five years old; she was twenty-three, an American. For six years they worked side by side at becoming artists. Then Hughes initiated an affair with another woman, and the marriage collapsed. Hughes moved out and, exactly four months later, Plath committed suicide, leaving behind their two very young children. One of the most mutually productive literary marriages of the twentieth century had lasted only about twenty-three hundred days. But until they uncoupled their lives in October 1962, each witnessed the creation of everything the other wrote, and engaged the other&#x2019;s work at the level of its artistic purposes, and recognized the ingenu-ity of solutions to artistic problems that they both understood very well. This kind of collaboration is quite uncommon between artists, especially if they are married to each other, and after the publication of Hughes&#x2019;s prizewinning first book, The Hawk in the Rain, the marriage began attracting the attention of journalists. In January 1961, Hughes and Plath were interviewed for a radio broadcast on the BBC, Two of a Kind, that displays them at the apex of their compatibility. The interviewer, Owen Leeming, asked whether theirs was &#x201c;a marriage of opposites.&#x201d; As if in a movie by Woody Allen, Hughes said they were &#x201c;very different&#x201d; at the same moment Plath said they were &#x201c;quite similar.&#x201d; Explaining &#x201c;different,&#x201d; Hughes allowed that he and Plath had similar dispositions, and worked at the same pace&#x2014;indeed, so deep were the similarities that he often felt he was drawing on &#x201c;a single shared mind&#x201d; that each accessed by telepathy. But he and Plath drew on this shared mind for quite different purposes, he said, and each of their imaginations led a thoroughly &#x201c;secret life.&#x201d;</p><p>Explaining &#x201c;similar,&#x201d; Plath said that though she and Hughes had very different backgrounds, she kept discovering unexpected likenesses. Hughes&#x2019;s fascination with animals, for example, had opened up for her the subject of beekeeping, which was one of her father&#x2019;s scholarly pursuits. More of her own history had become available to her poetry because Hughes was so interested in it, she said: that was how the similarities were developing in their work&#x2014;though the work itself was not at all similar, she insisted. Did she too believe they had a single shared mind? No, Plath laughed. &#x201c;Actually, I think I&#x2019;m a little more practical.&#x201d;</p><p>Just such a dance through the minefield of their differences characterized their partnership at its best. It succeeded because each of them invested wholeheartedly in whatever the other was working on, even when the outcome was of dubious merit. In the late 1950s, Hughes helped Plath develop plots for stories she could publish in women&#x2019;s magazines, even though he regarded fiction-writing as a false direction for Plath. At the time, he saw, accurately, that only conventional plots in which people got born, married, or killed released her distinctive &#x201c;demons,&#x201d; so he encouraged her to invest in whatever mode was most productive of tapping these unique sources of energy. Plath, for her part, loyally defended the incoherent and unmarketable plays in which Hughes promoted the esoteric ideas he was hooked on, beginning in the early 1960s&#x2014;she was as interested in his artistic strategies as she was in the results. Paradoxically, their intimate creative relationship enabled each of them to conduct better the &#x201c;secret life&#x201d; expressed in their art. The rupture in their marriage closed down this literary atelier. But poetry had brought Hughes and Plath together, and poetry kept them together until Hughes&#x2019;s death in 1998. Hughes inherited Plath&#x2019;s unpublished manuscripts, appointed himself her editor and made her famous. In 1965, when he brought out the volume titled Ariel, which contained Plath&#x2019;s last work, he said proudly, &#x201c;This is just like her&#x2014;but permanent.&#x201d; By that year, the world was ready to agree with him about Plath&#x2019;s importance. Poets rarely become cultural icons, but Plath&#x2019;s suicide had occurred just when women&#x2019;s writing was beginning to stimulate the postwar women&#x2019;s movement. The posthumous publication of Plath&#x2019;s poetry, fiction, letters and journals added her voice to a swelling chorus of resistance to the traditional positions women occupied in social life. The more celebrated Sylvia Plath became, the more people wanted to know what role her marriage to Ted Hughes had played in the catastrophe of her decision to die&#x2014;especially after it became widely known that the woman Hughes left her for, Assia Wevill, had also committed suicide and had killed the daughter she had borne to Hughes.</p><p>Hughes spent the rest of his life quashing public discussion of these painful episodes in his private life. But shortly before his death in 1998, he released two books of poems that explore the subject of what it meant to have been the husband of Sylvia Plath. One was titled Birthday Letters. Speaking to Plath as if she were looking back with him from the vantage of their middle age, Hughes reflected on the array of circumstances that drove them together in 1956, and kept them together for six years; and he also proposed an explanation of the psychological issues behind her suicide.</p><p>Birthday Letters became a huge commercial success, but most people never even heard about the other book, Howls and Whispers, which was published in an expensive limited edition, and was never reviewed in the press. To make Howls and Whispers Hughes had reserved eleven poems from the manuscripts that became Birthday Letters, as a winemaker sets aside the choicest vintage for special labeling. In its keynote poem, &#x201c;The Offers,&#x201d; the ghost of Sylvia Plath appears to Ted Hughes three times. On each visit she tests him; on the last visit she warns, &#x201c;This time don&#x2019;t fail me.&#x201d;</p><p>That startling phrase sends a pulse of light back through every page Hughes had published since Plath&#x2019;s death. It points our attention to the theme in Hughes&#x2019;s work of how marriages fail, or how men fail in marriage. Sometimes his work contains a representation of himself as the character who fails, as in Birthday Letters. In other writings, such as the translations of the grand works of Western literature with which Hughes occupied himself toward the end of his life&#x2014;Racine&#x2019;s Ph�dre, Tales from Ovid, the Alcestis of Euripides&#x2014;Hughes brings empathy to the theme of marriage under duress. His versions of these were all produced for the stage, and audiences were quick to intuit that a second passionate story&#x2014;Hughes&#x2019;s own story&#x2014;was being explored, inexactly, within the dynamics of a venerable classic.</p><p>Though only 110 copies of Howls and Whispers were printed, Hughes acquired a large audience for its most important poem, &#x201c;The Offers,&#x201d; by releasing it in the London Sunday Times on October 18, 1998. Ten days later, Hughes died. Whether by accident or design, that sentence spoken by Sylvia Plath through the medium of Ted Hughes would be on record as his last words. Birthday Letters offers us a way to see Ted Hughes from inside his partnership with Plath; &#x201c;The Offers&#x201d; requires that we see them as inseparable, even in death. &#x201c;This time, don&#x2019;t fail me&#x201d; is the voice of poetry itself, which Plath embodied; the persona created in his work is her husband; and that persona is his contribution to the history of poetry.</p><p>Hughes began developing this autobiographical persona, her husband, when he was nearly fifty years old. After years of attempting to avoid autobiographical writing, Hughes had come to believe that the voice in poetry had to issue from a human being situated in historical time and place, engaged in attempting to &#x201c;cure&#x201d; a wounding blow to his psyche inflicted by an historically significant conflict. The struggle conducted in a poet&#x2019;s art was his way of participating in history. Hughes also saw that no single work of writing stood alone, that a strong writer&#x2019;s work proceeded by accretion over time. Hughes observed that the poetic DNA expressed itself in single, definitive images or a &#x201c;knot of obsessions&#x201d; produced early in the poet&#x2019;s career and repeated in variations thereafter. Like the cells of a developing foetus, each work contained the DNA of the whole man, that is, the whole image of the persona.</p><p>&#x201c;The Offers&#x201d; is the central poem in Hughes&#x2019;s work of self-mythologizing. It marks the turning point in his creative life, showing in a set of images how the poet&#x2019;s powers were summoned back to him following the two successive personal disasters of the suicides of women close to him. What would it mean not to fail the claims that Woman had made on his psyche from childhood on? How could he negotiate the urgency of contradictory needs for separation from her, and for dialogue with her? During the last two decades of his career, these questions informed works of lasting importance by Ted Hughes. These included Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being, in which he investigated the conflicted &#x201c;way of loving&#x201d; to be found in Shakespeare&#x2019;s writing; and the autobiographical poems wherein Hughes provided himself with a mythical childhood, much in the manner of Wordsworth, setting forth an account of the growth of the poet&#x2019;s mind. But in Hughes&#x2019;s account, marriage was the culmination of that developmental path. And marriage forced a man into the underground of his own darkness. In &#x201c;The Offers,&#x201d; he is stepping naked back into the world, no longer in the form of a man, but as a persona.</p><p>This is the myth that can be pieced together from its scattered manifestations in Hughes&#x2019;s published works and private papers; and Hughes made sure that it could be found. The year before his death, he sold a very large collection of his manuscripts and letters to Emory University in Atlanta. And during the latter years of his career, anxious about his relationship to posterity, he responded generously to inquiries from scholars and critics interested in his work, and granted interviews about his beliefs and practices, and about his personal life.</p><p>In just such ways did Ted Hughes insure that his persona as a poet would survive him and would slowly work its way into the consciousness of posterity. He said as much to Sylvia Plath&#x2019;s mother, Aurelia, back in 1975 while they were editing some of Plath&#x2019;s correspondence for publication. Hughes requested that many references to himself be excised from this book. Aurelia Plath protested that Hughes was asking her to leave out too many informative details. He responded in a long letter, of which he made a carbon copy that he placed in his own archive. &#x201c;An impartial scholar will eventually&#x2014;no doubt&#x2014;put all these notes in quite pitilessly,&#x201d; he assured her. &#x201c;In time everything will be quite clear, whatever has been hidden will lie in the open.&#x201d;</p><p>Hughes was speaking, specifically, about his relationship to Sylvia Plath. He understood that after his death the story of their marriage would belong to the cultural history of the twentieth century. As he knew, the totality of his work contained a unique and poignant account of how they struggled together to become writers: what each gave, what each took; how their marriage floundered and their art did not. Her Husband threads together the story Hughes told and the history that surrounds the story. Drawing from his books and papers, it follows a single line of inquiry through the maze of Hughes&#x2019;s life as he enters into the partnership, struggles and prospers in it, loses the partner but not the relationship, and turns the marriage into a resonant myth.<br><br><b>chapter one</b><br><br>Meeting<br>(1956)<br>Ted Hughes believed that destiny had singled him out to become the husband of Sylvia Plath. &#x201c;The solar system married us,&#x201d; he claimed, when he re-created their meeting in Birthday Letters, locating the astrological coordinates very precisely. The date was Saturday, February 25, 1956, under the sign of Pisces, in the zodiac; the place was Cambridge University, from which Hughes had graduated a year and a half earlier. During the week he was living in a borrowed flat in London, working at a glamorous-sounding day job as a reader of fiction submissions at the film company J. Arthur Rank. But he continued to spend his weekends in Cambridge, hanging out with friends, mainly poets who were still enrolled at the university. They were ambitious, idealistic, apprentice artists, and that winter Hughes joined them in putting together a very small, very literary magazine, St. Botolph&#x2019;s Review. One of the contributors, an American named Lucas Myers, lived in a repurposed chicken coop behind the rectory of St. Botolph&#x2019;s Church, off campus. His residence inspired the cheeky title&#x2014;these poets were ultra-anti-establishment. Friends began peddling copies of St. Botolph&#x2019;s Review around the Cambridge colleges on publication day, spreading word that a launch party would be held at rooms in Falcon Yard that night. Sylvia Plath bought a copy from an American cousin of one of the poets, and he invited her to the launch.</p><p>Plath accepted immediately; here was an opportunity she had been waiting for. She was studying literature at Cambridge on a two-year Fulbright Fellowship after graduating from Smith, a prestigious women&#x2019;s college in New England. Her writing had won minor literary prizes in the United States and was beginning to appear in such American magazines as Harper&#x2019;s, Mademoiselle, The Nation, and Atlantic Monthly. Arriving at Cambridge, she had quickly learned that the literary world was tightly networked in Britain; even the limpest student publications were scouted for new talent by London publishers, who were often themselves Cambridge graduates. She immediately began submitting work to college publications. In January, two of her poems had been printed in a little magazine called Chequer&#x2014;and not only published but, to her amazement, scoffed at, in a fierce little low-budget paper called Broadsheet, which was produced every two weeks on a mimeograph machine by some of the St. Botolph poets. The men who reviewed Plath&#x2019;s poems disliked on principle the formal verse at which she was very skillful, and on principle they derided what they disliked. &#x201c;Quaint and eclectic artfulness,&#x201d; the reviewer labeled Plath&#x2019;s style, then added, &#x201c;My better half tells me &#x2018;Fraud, fraud,&#x2019; but I will not say so; who am I to know how beautiful she may be.&#x201d;</p><p>The stapled pages of Broadsheet were read avidly by the local poets, and Plath was mortified at being so manhandled. This had been her first exposure to the blokishness of English literary culture. What bothered her most, though, was that little refrain &#x201c;fraud, fraud.&#x201d; Plath was aware of her shortcomings and didn&#x2019;t like them to be noticed by others. Yet the critic&#x2019;s rhetoric gave her an opening. Did he want to see whether she was beautiful? She would introduce herself. She put on a pair of red party shoes and smoothed back her pageboy with a red hair band, then went to a bar with her date for the evening, where she fortified herself with several whiskeys. But before getting high she had fortified herself another way: she had memorized some of the poems in St. Botolph&#x2019;s Review.</p><p>The party was well under way by the time Plath arrived in Falcon Yard and climbed in her red shoes up the stairs to the Women&#x2019;s Union, where a jazzy combo hammered music into the babble of raised voices. Plath started working the r...</p></p><h2>Dream Theater - Images and Words</h2><p>(Guitar Recorded Versions). 8 songs from their hit album in notes &amp; tab, with transcriptions by guitar god John Petrucci.

Travellers in the Third Reich is an extraordinary history of the rise of the Nazis based on fascinating first-hand accounts, drawing together a multitude of voices and stories, including students, politicians, musicians, diplomats, schoolchildren, communists, scholars, athletes, poets, journalists, fascists, artists, tourists, even celebrities like Charles Lindbergh and Samuel Beckett. Their experiences create a remarkable three-dimensional picture of Germany under Hitler - one so palpable that the reader will feel, hear, even breathe the atmosphere. These are the accidental eyewitnesses to history. Disturbing, absurd, moving, and ranging from the deeply trivial to the deeply tragic, their tales give a fresh insight into the complexities of the Third Reich, its paradoxes and its ultimate destruction.</p><p>Julia Boyd is the author of A Dance with the Dragon: The Vanished World of Peking&#39;s Foreign Colony, The Excellent Doctor Blackwell: The Life of the First Woman Physician and Hannah Riddell: An Englishwoman in Japan.

It warns us that we, with our all-seeing hindsight, might ourselves have been fooled or beguiled or inclined to make excuses, had we been there at the time. I can thoroughly recommend it as a contribution to knowledge and an absorbing and stimulating book in itself&#34; - Peter Hitchens, Mail on Sunday; &#34;A fascinating book&#34; -- Robert Elms, BBC Radio London; &#34;To a younger generation it seems incomprehensible that after the tragic Great War people and political leaders allowed themselves to march into the abyss again. Julia Boyd&#39;s book, drawing on wide experience and forensic research, seeks to answer some of these questions.&#34; -- Randolph Churchill; &#34;With an almost novelistic touch, [Boyd] presents a range of stories of human interest ... The uncomfortable moral of Travellers in the Third Reich is that people see and hear only what they already want to see and hear&#34; -- David Pryce-Jones, Standpoint; &#34;Fascinating ... This absorbing and beautifully organised book is full of small encounters that jolt the reader into a historical past that seems still very near&#34; - Lucy Lethbridge, The Tablet; &#34;In the 1930s the most cultured and technologically advanced country in Europe tumbled into the abyss. In this deeply researched book Julia Boyd lets us view Germany&#39;s astonishing fall through foreign eyes. Her vivid tapestry of human stories is a delightful, often moving read. It also offers sobering lessons for our own day when strong leaders are again all the rage&#34; -- Professor David Reynolds, author of The Long Shadow: The Great War and the 20th Century; &#34;Drawing on the unpublished experiences of outsiders inside the Third Reich, Julia Boyd provides dazzling new perspectives on the Germany that Hitler built. Her book is a tour de force of historical research&#34; - Dr Piers Brendon, author of The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s&#34;What was Nazi Germany really like in the run up to the Second World War? Julia Boyd&#39;s painstakingly researched and deeply nuanced book shows how this troubled country appeared to travellers of the 1930s who did not have the benefit of hindsight. A truly fascinating read&#34; -- Keith Lowe, Sunday Times bestselling author of Savage Continent and Inferno; &#34;Engrossing ... skilfully woven together to create a three-dimensional picture of Germany under Hitler that has many resonances for today&#34; -- Caroline Sanderson, The Bookseller; &#34;A revealing and original account. Some of Adolf Hitler&#39;s fellow travellers, lulled by self-deception, gulled by propaganda, deluded themselves about Nazi Germany as they deceived others&#34; - Sir John Tusa; &#34;Julia Boyd has conducted a vast range and volume of research. The numerous witnesses of Germany under Hitler whom she quotes have different ages, nationalities, backgrounds and opinions. Out of the multitude of first-hand accounts she spins a tapestry which is full of vivid detail and gradually creates a coherent whole. The horrors of the Hitler regime and how it came to power, and the suffering of ordinary people, are brought to life. The book is comprehensive, informative and full of life. I wish I could have read it before I first worked in post-war Germany. I would have understood better the Germans whom I knew and admired even more what West Germans achieved after 1945. A glorious read for anyone with an interest in the history of the twentieth century&#34; - Sir Christopher Mallaby, former ambassador to Germany and France; &#34;Unique, original and engagingly written. This account of visitors and tourists to Germany brings to life these difficult decades in a most refreshing way [and] should attract a wide circle of readers&#34; - Dr Zare Steiner, author of The Lights that Failed: European International History 1919-1933 and Triumph of the Dark: 1933-193; &#34;An entertaining popular history ... a fascinating book. Boyd lets the voices from the past speak to us ... opinions that are sometimes shocking and often thought provoking.

John Parsons, a maverick rocketeer whose work had helped transform the rocket from a derided sci-fi plotline into a reality, was at first mourned as a tragically young victim of mishandled chemicals. But as reporters dug deeper a shocking story emerged. Parsons had been performing occult rites and summoning spirits as a follower of Alesteir Crowley, and he was promptly written off as an embarrassment to science. George Pendle tells Parsons&#39; extraordinary life story for the first time. Fuelled from childhood by dreams of space flight, Parsons was a crucial innovator during rocketry&#39;s birth. But his visionary imagination also led him into the occult community thriving in 1930s Los Angeles, and when fantasy&#39;s pull became stronger than reality, he lost both his work and his wife. Parsons was just emerging from his personal underworld when he died - aged thirty-seven. In Strange Angel, Pendle recovers a fascinating life and explores the unruly consequences of genius.</p><p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2005, 0-15-100997-X<br>"Forget geek stereotypes.

John Parsons, a maverick rocketeer who helped transform the rocket from a derided sci-fi plotline into a reality, was at first mourned as a scientific prodigy. But reporters soon uncovered a more shocking story: Parsons had been a devotee of black magic. <br><br>In this dazzling portrait of prewar superstition, cold war paranoia, and futuristic possibility, George Pendle re-creates the world of John Parsons, leader of the motley band of enthusiastic young men who founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a cornerstone of the American space program. With a cast of characters including Howard Hughes, L. Ron Hubbard, and Robert Heinlein, Strange Angel explores the unruly consequences of genius. <br><br>"[Pendle] depicts Parsons' short, spectacular life as akin to one of his early rocket tests &#x2014; a brilliant flash, a quick soar, and an inevitable, erratic fizzle back to Earth. Pendle weaves a fascinating yarn, reaching from the earliest sci-fi dreams of manned spaceflight to the real-life trial-and-error process that would eventually make it possible." --Seattle Times<br><br>GEORGE PENDLE writes about science, art, and culture for the Times (London), the Sunday Times, and the Financial Times, among other publications.

It includes at least a half-dozen planetary bodies and is many times larger and much older than our own star and its system. <p> Arcturian involvement with our system began over three million years ago when a space colony -- a galactic space station -- was established on Velatropa 24.4, otherwise known as Mars. With its 40,000-year warm cycles, Mars provided the perfect experimental way station. If anything went wrong, at least those on the Arcturus system would not be affected -- or so it was thought. Some of those in command of the Martian project had not considered carefully enough the inexorable efficacy of karma, the law of cause and effect. </p><p> By the time strange events began to transpire on Mars, little did anyone on Mars or Arcturus reckon the strange consequences of forgetting about each other's mutual existence. Thus unfolds the tale of the Arcturian experimental way station, V.24.4, otherwise known as Mars.</p></p><p>Jose Arguelles, Ph.D. (1939-2011), worked full time on behalf of the World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement and was president of the Foundation for the Law of Time.

She reveals how decision makers draw from ideas about talent&#x2015;what it is, what best signals it, and who does (and does not) have it&#x2015;that are deeply rooted in social class. Displaying the "right stuff" that elite employers are looking for entails considerable amounts of economic, social, and cultural resources on the part of the applicants and their parents.</p><p>Challenging our most cherished beliefs about college as a great equalizer and the job market as a level playing field, <i>Pedigree</i> exposes the class biases built into American notions about the best and the brightest, and shows how social status plays a significant role in determining who reaches the top of the economic ladder.</p></p><p><p>"In this riveting account of how the nation's top investment banks, consultancies, and law firms choose employees, Lauren Rivera goes inside the recruitment process, interviewing the interviewers and sitting in on their decision meetings.

New religious movements (NRMs) often present novel doctrines and advocate unfamiliar modes of behavior, and have therefore often been perceived as controversial. NRMs have, however, in recent years come to be treated in the same way as established religions, that is, as complex cultural phenomena involving myths, rituals and canonical texts. This Companion discusses key features of NRMs from a systematic, comparative perspective, summarizing results of forty years of research. The volume addresses NRMs that have caught media attention, including movements such as Scientology, New Age, the Neopagans, the Sai Baba movement and Jihadist movements active in a post-9/11 context. An essential resource for students of religious studies, the history of religion, sociology, anthropology and the psychology of religion.</p><p>This volume offers reliable information on new religions such as Scientology, the Moonies and Jihadist movements, including current theories regarding their status as complex cultural phenomena involving myths, rituals and canonical texts.

Examining Africa and Africans in the context of the global themes of liberation, economic development, and popular culture, author Jonathan T. Reynolds illustrates how Africans sought to define their own lives on a global stage.<br><br>The first three chapters of <em>Sovereignty and Struggle</em> offer a thematic approach, covering the politics of early liberation struggles, economics, and global Cold War complexities. They provide students with insight into the motivations and aspirations of Africans from around the continent during the Cold War period.

It is smart, engaging, and thought-provoking in its coverage of sovereignty--and its many possibilities and variations--in Cold War era Africa. I particularly appreciate its efforts to move beyond well-trodden discussions of political and economic developments and to look at the various ways in which sovereignty was marketed, performed, defined, and embraced in 'unofficial' realms like the stage, newspapers, and airplanes. It is very well-conceived and carried out."--Nate Plageman, <em>Wake Forest University</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"The focus on decolonization, the debt crisis, and new cultural expressions and music will help students to appreciate the complex nature of Africa's relation with the external world.

Using a new institutionalist approach, Zegart asks what forces shaped the initial design of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Council in ways that meant they were handicapped from birth.</p> <p>Ironically, she finds that much of the blame can be ascribed to cherished features of American democracy&#x2015;frequent elections, the separation of powers, majority rule, political compromise&#x2015;all of which constrain presidential power and give Congress little incentive to create an effective foreign policy system. At the same time, bureaucrats in rival departments had the expertise, the staying power, and the incentives to sabotage the creation of effective competitors, and this is exactly what they did. </p> <p>Historical evidence suggests that most political players did not consider broad national concerns when they forged the CIA, JCS, and NSC in the late 1940s. Although President Truman aimed to establish a functional foreign policy system, he was stymied by self-interested bureaucrats, legislators, and military leaders. The NSC was established by accident, as a byproduct of political compromise; Navy opposition crippled the JCS from the outset; and the CIA emerged without the statutory authority to fulfill its assigned role thanks to the Navy, War, State, and Justice departments, which fought to protect their own intelligence apparatus.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the new security agencies performed poorly as they struggled to overcome their crippled evolution. Only the NSC overcame its initial handicaps as several presidents exploited loopholes in the National Security Act of 1947 to reinvent the NSC staff. The JCS, by contrast, remained mired in its ineffective design for nearly forty years&#x2015;i.e., throughout the Cold War&#x2015;and the CIA&#x2019;s pivotal analysis branch has never recovered from its origins. In sum, the author paints an astonishing picture: the agencies Americans count on most to protect them from enemies abroad are, by design, largely incapable of doing so.</p></p><p>&#x201c;Based on voluminous historical materials, this book is a must-read for all serious students of the American foreign policy process.&#x201d;&#x2014;General Brent Scowcroft, Former National Security Advisor<br>&#x201c;Zegart&#x2019;s incisive and revealing new book . . . convincingly argues that U.S. interests have been compromised . . . by the institutional design of national security agencies.&#x201d;&#x2014;Washington MonthlyAmy B.

It lends itself well to use in course work; however, because of its consistent clear illustrations of theoretical difficulties, the book is also ideal for self-study.<br>Since all higher analysis depends on the theory of numbers, Professor Knopp (formerly Professor of Mathematics, University of T�bingen) begins with an introduction to the theory of real numbers, an indispensable foundation for what is to come. This introduction is followed by an extensive account of the theory of sequences and the actual theory of infinite series. The latter is covered in two stages: (1) the classical theory (2) later developments of the 19th century.<br>Carefully selected exercises have been included throughout, emphasizing applications of the theory, rather than purely theoretical considerations.<br>Aimed at students already acquainted with the elements of differential and integral calculus, this work grew out of the author's lectures and course work at the universities of Berlin and K�nigsberg. This pedagogical background helped him achieve a work of utmost clarity and precision &#x2014; one that belongs in the library of every serious mathematician or student of higher analysis.</p><p>Text: English<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Speaker&#39;s Handbook, Spiral bound Version</h2><p>Helping you build your public speaking skills for a variety of contexts, THE SPEAKER&#39;S HANDBOOK, 12th Edition, covers the entire process of preparing, organizing, developing and delivering a speech, making it the ideal resource for beginning and experienced speakers alike.

This is explained in a way that is thorough but not mathematical. It compares differing approaches, and also provides a historical perspective, showing how such thinking has been around since the beginning of civilisation. It emphasises the difference between a complexity worldview and the dominant mechanical worldview that underpins much of current management practice. It defines the complexity worldview as recognising the world is interconnected, shaped by history and the particularities of context. The comparison of the differing approaches to modelling complexity is unique in its depth and accessibility. <br><br>The second part of the book uses this lens of complexity to explore issues in the fields of management, strategy, economics, and international development. It also explores how to facilitate others to recognise the implications of adopting a complex rather than a mechanical worldview and suggests methods of research to explore systemic, path-dependent emergent aspects of situations. <br><br>The authors of this book span both science and management, academia and practice, thus the explanations of science are authoritative and yet the examples of changing how you live and work in the world are real and accessible. The aim of the book is to bring alive what complexity is all about and to illustrate the importance of loosening the grip of a modernist worldview with its hope for prediction, certainty and control.<br></p><p><br>Jean G.

There are about 8,000 named species of moths in our region, and although most are unnoticed by the public, many attract attention when their larvae create economic damage: eating holes in woolens, infesting stored foods, boring into apples, damaging crops and garden plants, or defoliating forests. In contrast to previous North American moth books, this volume discusses and illustrates about 25% of the species in every family, including the tiny species, making this the most comprehensive volume in its field. With this approach it provides access to microlepidoptera study for biologists as well as amateur collectors. About 2,500 species are described and illustrated, including virtually all moths of economic importance, summarizing their morphology, taxonomy, adult behavior, larval biology, and life cycles.</p><p>"Two of North America's most prolific and respected specialists on moths&#x2015;particularly those of the West&#x2015;have combined over a century of experience and scholarship to introduce western moths of all families authoritatively to both the amateur and the experienced professional entomologist. This biologically oriented and beautifully illustrated treatment of a quarter of all known western moth species fills a long-needed void, and does it superbly."&#x2015;Charles V. Covell Jr., author of <i>A Field Guide to Moths of Eastern North America</i><br><br>"This work sets a new high water mark for North American lepidopterology. Considering the authors' century of combined studies of western Lepidoptera, it is clear from the outset that no other team could have delivered a work so rich in taxonomic and life history information, much of it being original and appearing in the literature for the first time. I will read my copy more like a novel than a reference work, casting about the accounts and repeatedly flipping through the 2300 color images to better familiarize myself with our continent's rich and handsome diversity of moths. <i>Moths of Western North America</i> will serve as both gateway and catalyst for the study of moths for decades, and especially for microlepidopterans&#x2015;for whom no like work exists in the New World."&#x2015;David L.

And yet, argues sociologist Randall Collins, they and much else in our social lives are driven by a common force: interaction rituals. <i>Interaction Ritual Chains</i> is a major work of sociological theory that attempts to develop a "radical microsociology." It proposes that successful rituals create symbols of group membership and pump up individuals with emotional energy, while failed rituals drain emotional energy. Each person flows from situation to situation, drawn to those interactions where their cultural capital gives them the best emotional energy payoff. Thinking, too, can be explained by the internalization of conversations within the flow of situations; individual selves are thoroughly and continually social, constructed from the outside in.</p><br><p> The first half of <i>Interaction Ritual Chains</i> is based on the classic analyses of Durkheim, Mead, and Goffman and draws on micro-sociological research on conversation, bodily rhythms, emotions, and intellectual creativity. The second half discusses how such activities as sex, smoking, and social stratification are shaped by interaction ritual chains. For example, the book addresses the emotional and symbolic nature of sexual exchanges of all sorts--from hand-holding to masturbation to sexual relationships with prostitutes--while describing the interaction rituals they involve. This book will appeal not only to psychologists, sociologists, and anthropologists, but to those in fields as diverse as human sexuality, religious studies, and literary theory.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Interaction Ritual Chains</i> is a major statement by a major scholar at the top of his game. Starting with a parsimonious set of insights gleaned from the best current work in microsociology, the author builds a compelling theory of how these insights can inform models of the behavior of families, communities, organizations, and nation-states. The book will measurably shape the way that social scientists approach the business of understanding and explaining human behavior."<b>--Paul DiMaggio, Princeton University</b></p><p>"This book elaborates an original, bold theory about fundamental social processes that is likely to generate considerable debate among social scientists. It is also the most important statement of one of sociology's most distinguished theorists. Collins' contribution will be seminal not only because it brings to the fore the often neglected emotional dimension of social life, but also because it pushes further our understanding of group boundaries in the production of social inequality. It will become a must for all social scientists, including those who will disagree."<b>--Mich�le Lamont, Professor of Sociology, Harvard University, and author of <i>The Dignity of Working Men</i></b></p><b>Randall Collins</b> is Professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania.

Neither an evasive apology nor a wholesome condemnation, his book distinguished between types of guilt and degrees of responsibility. He listed four categories of guilt: criminal guilt (the commitment of overt acts), political guilt (the degree of political acquiescence in the Nazi regime), moral guilt (a matter of private judgment among one&#x2019;s friends), and metaphysical guilt (a universally shared responsibility of those who chose to remain alive rather than die in protest against Nazi atrocities). <br>Karl Jaspers (1883&#x2013;1969) took his degree in medicine but soon became interested in psychiatry. He is the author of a standard work of psychopathology, as well as special studies on Strindberg, Van Gogh and Nietsche. After World War I he became Professor of Philosophy at Heidelberg, where he achieved fame as a brilliant teacher and an early exponent of existentialism. He was among the first to acquaint German readers with the works of Kierkegaard. </p><p>Jaspers had to resign from his post in 1935. From the total isolation into which the Hitler regime forced him, Jaspers returned in 1945 to a position of central intellectual leadership of the younger liberal elements of Germany. In his first lecture in 1945, he forcefully reminded his audience of the fate of the German Jews. Jaspers&#x2019;s unblemished record as an anti-Nazi, as well as his sentient mind, have made him a rallying point center for those of his compatriots who wish to reconstruct a free and democratic Germany.</p></p><p>Karl Jasper (1883-1969) took his degree in medicine but soon became interested in psychiatry.

Readers will find illuminating discussion of the complete symphonies of Beethoven, Schumann, Brahms, Sibelius, and Mahler, as well as of the most loved symphonic works of Schubert, Bruckner, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, and others. We learn how to listen more sharply for Haydn's humor, to Mozart's singular combination of pathos with grace, and to the evolution of Beethoven's musical ideas in his nine symphonies. This remarkable range and variety of composers are illuminated by Steinberg's deft, inviting, and intensely personal essays, which give such a vivid portrait of each composer's personality that the reader gets an immediate sense of how the work is a direct expression of the person from whose soul and brain it has sprung.<br>Tracing the ways in which composers have dealt with the musical challenges that have engaged them throughout the centuries, Steinberg takes us through the revolutions of expression, sound, and form that have shaped the symphony's remarkable history. Whether beginners or veterans, music lovers will listen to the symphony with enlivened interest and deeper understanding with Steinberg's masterful guide in hand.<br></p><p>Anyone compiling a guide to the symphony faces two problems: impartiality versus personal enthusiasm and detailed musical analysis versus help for the newcomer. Michael Steinberg succeeds brilliantly at the task, as he has with his guide to the concerto. He has pared this vast repertory down to 118 entries (Franck and Bizet being the surprising omissions), thus keeping room for music by Schmidt, Hartmann, Harbison, Piston, and Tippett. Many of the chapters have helpful general introductions; the brief one on Mendelssohn and the longer one on Schubert are ideal. The Mahler chapter is superb, with consideration of the original version of the First Symphony and the unfinished Tenth Symphony framing a chronological discussion of the works. Steinberg includes all texts and translations of vocal movements and places even isolated works (such as G�recki's wholly atypical Third Symphony) in context. Absent is the clubby tone that infects classical music programming on public radio, and readers will not need to follow scores to understand Steinberg's points. There are some great but peripheral tidbits in the footnotes, as well as frequently trenchant quotations from various composers' letters. Best of all, Steinberg has clear concerns and enthusiasms: orchestral seating plans for the violins and the reasons that repeats in first movements are so often disregarded become refrains. The descriptions of William Schuman's Sixth Symphony and Bohuslav Martinu's <i>Fantaisies Symphoniques</i> may send readers rushing to listen, and the overly familiar Beethoven <i>Eroica</i> and Schubert "Unfinished" are once again fantastical, odd, and fresh in these pages. In Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony, we read, "the oboe is the sweetest and most seductive of tour guides." Steinberg might well have been describing himself. <i>--William R.

With the Anatomy Act of 1832, however, the bodies of those who died destitute in workhouses were appropriated for dissection. At a time when such a procedure was regarded with fear and revulsion, the Anatomy Act effectively rendered dissection a punishment for poverty.

Yet surprisingly, there has never been a clinical introduction to Freud's work that might be of use to students and professionals in their everyday lives and careers. Until now.</p><p>Bruce Fink, who is his generation's most respected translator of Lacan's work and a profound interpreter of Freud's, has written the definitive clinical introduction to Freud. This book presents Freud in an eminently usable way, providing readers with a plethora of examples from everyday life and clinical practice illustrating the insightfulness and continued applicability of Freud's ideas.</p><p>The overriding focus is on techniques Freud developed for going directly toward the unconscious, illustrating how we can employ them today and perhaps even improve on them. Fink also lays out many of Freud's fundamental concepts&#x2015;such as repression, isolation, displacement, anxiety, affect, free association, repetition, obsession, and wish-fulfillment&#x2015;and situates them in highly applicable clinical contexts.</p><p>The emphasis throughout is on the myriad techniques developed by Freud that clinicians of all backgrounds and orientations can draw upon to put in their therapy toolbox, whether or not they identify as "Freudians."</p><p>With references ranging from Star Trek and the Moody Blues to hard drives and unicorns, Bruce Fink's elegant writing brings Freud into sharp focus for clinicians of all backgrounds. To readers who ask with an open mind "<em>Does this approach allow me to see anything that I had not seen before in my clinical work?</em>" this book will offer many new insights.</p></p><p>Bruce Fink, PhD, is a practicing Lacanian psychoanalyst and analytic supervisor who trained in France with the psychoanalytic institute Jacques Lacan created shortly before his death, the&nbsp;Ecole de la Cause freudienne&nbsp;in Paris. He has translated several of Lacan's works into English&#x2015;including&nbsp;Ecrits: The First Complete Edition in English, Seminar XX: Encore, and&nbsp;Seminar VIII,&nbsp;Transference&#x2015;and is the author of numerous books on Lacan, including&nbsp;The Lacanian Subject, A Clinical Introduction to Lacanian Psychoanalysis, Lacan to the Letter, Fundamentals of Psychoanalytic Technique, Against Understanding&nbsp;(2 volumes), and most recently&nbsp;Lacan on Love. A board member of the Pittsburgh Psychoanalytic Center, he has also penned several mysteries involving a character loosely based on Jacques Lacan:&nbsp;The Psychoanalytic Adventures of Inspector Canal, Death by Analysis, Odor di Murderer/Scent of a Killer,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Purloined Love.&#x201c;Until this book, there has been no rigorous introduction to Freud for clinicians in English. Bruce Fink has not only written a superb guide for those who work in the talking therapies, but he has also managed to produce a kind of psychopathology of everyday life in the consulting room. Expositions of theory are combined with examples that will resonate with every clinician's daily practice, making a truly persuasive case for the contemporary relevance of Freud. Avoiding hagiography, Fink is both a generous and a critical reader of Freud, and I would recommend this book not only to clinicians but to anyone seeking a general introduction to Freudian theory and practice.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Darian Leader, Psychoanalyst, Centre for Freudian Analysis and Research, London</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Bruce Fink's <em>Clinical Introduction to Freud</em> is a richly and refreshingly technique-focused work addressed to a wide range of practicing and aspiring clinicians.

They next treat the theory of photoelectric detection of light and photoelectric correlation. They then discuss in some detail quantum systems and effects. The book closes with two chapters devoted to laser theory and one on the quantum theory of nonlinear optics. The sound introduction to coherence theory and the quantum nature of light and the chapter-end exercises will appeal to graduate students and newcomers to the field. Researchers will find much of interest in the new results on coherence-induced spectral line shifts, nonclassical states of light, higher-order squeezing, and quantum effects of down-conversion. Written by two of the world&#39;s most highly regarded optical physicists, this book is required reading of all physicists and engineers working in optics.</p><p>This book presents a systematic account of optical coherence theory within the framework of classical optics, as applied to such topics as radiation from sources of different states of coherence, foundations of radiometry, effects of source coherence on the spectra of radiated fields, coherence theory of laser modes, and scattering of partially coherent light by random media.Emil Wolf is Wilson Professor of Optical Physics at the University of Rochester.</p><h2>Kosovo: What Everyone Needs to Know�</h2><p>On February 17, 2008, Kosovo declared its independence, becoming the seventh state to emerge from the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. A tiny country of just two million people, 90% of whom are ethnic Albanians, Kosovo is central-geographically, historically, and politically-to the future of the Western Balkans and, in turn, its potential future within the European Union. But the fate of both Kosovo, condemned by Serbian leaders as a "fake state" and the region as a whole, remains uncertain.<br> <br>In <em>Kosovo: What Everyone Needs to Know�</em>, Tim Judah provides a straight-forward guide to the complicated place that is Kosovo. Judah, who has spent years covering the region, offers succinct, penetrating answers to a wide range of questions: Why is Kosovo important? Who are the Albanians? Who are the Serbs? Why is Kosovo so important to Serbs? What role does Kosovo play in the region and in the world? Judah reveals how things stand now and presents the history and geopolitical dynamics that have led to it. The most important of these is the question of the right to self-determination, invoked by the Kosovo Albanians, as opposed to right of territorial integrity invoked by the Serbs. For many Serbs, Kosovo's declaration of independence and subsequent recognition has been traumatic, a savage blow to national pride. Albanians, on the other hand, believe their independence rights an historical wrong: the Serbian conquest (Serbs say "liberation") of Kosovo in 1912.<br><br>For anyone wishing to understand both the history and possible future of Kosovo at this pivotal moment in its history, this book offers a wealth of insight and information in a uniquely accessible format.<br><br><em>What Everyone Needs to Know</em>� is a registered trademark of Oxford University Press.<br></p><p><p><b><em>WHAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW About This Series</em></b></p> <p><b>Who it's for:</b></p> <p> Busy people with diverse interests, ranging from college students to professionals, who wish to inform themselves in a succinct yet authoritative manner about a particular topic.</p> <p><b>What's inside:</b></p> <p>An incisive approach to a complex and timely issue, laid out in a straight-forward, question-and-answer format.</p> <p><b>Meet Our Authors</b></p> <p> Top experts in their given fields, ranging from an <i>Economist</i> correspondent to a director at the Council on Foreign Relations, you can trust our authors&#x2019; expertise and guidance.</p> <p><b>Popular Topics in the "<i>What Everyone Needs to Know</i>" Series</b></p> <ul> <li>International Politics</li> <li>Environmental Policies</li> <li>World History</li> <li>Sciences &amp; Math</li> <li>Religion &amp; Spirituality</li> </ul><br><strong>Tim Judah</strong> is a correspondent for <em>The Economist</em> covering the Balkans.

In a world riven by social and economic crises, from rising inequality to the decay of democratic institutions and profound technological disruption, Polanyi&#x2019;s path-breaking account of the dynamics of market capitalism and his defence of society and nature against the dangerous tendencies of the market capitalist system are more relevant than ever. <br><br>This book brings together Polanyi&#x2019;s most important articles and essays to give a unique selection of his essential shorter writings, mixing classic texts with significant but previously little-known pieces. It highlights the coherence and richness of Polanyi&#x2019;s theoretical and political approach, making it indispensable for understanding his overarching intellectual contribution. The volume includes his interwar writings, which deal with the world economic crisis and the socialist alternative to conservative and fascist developments; his reflection on political theory and the international situation after the war; and his comparative studies of economic institutions. Polanyi&#x2019;s political writings are complemented and supported by the critique of economic determinism and what he termed &#x2018;our obsolete market mentality&#x2019;. <br><br>This book is an invaluable companion to Polanyi&#x2019;s masterpiece, The Great Transformation, and an essential resource for students and scholars of political economy, sociology, history and political philosophy. <br></p><p><b>Karl Polanyi</b> (1886-1964) was one of the most influential political economists of recent times.

Adorno, Bertolt Brecht, Fritz Lang, and Arnold Schoenberg&#x2015;who had fled Nazi Germany. During their years in exile, they would produce a substantial body of major works to address the crisis of modernism that resulted from the rise of National Socialism. Weimar Germany and its culture, with its meld of eighteenth-century German classicism and twentieth-century modernism, served as a touchstone for this group of diverse talents and opinions.<br><br><i>Weimar on the Pacific</i> is the first book to examine these artists and intellectuals as a group. Ehrhard Bahr studies selected works of Adorno, Horkheimer, Brecht, Lang, Neutra, Schindler, D�blin, Mann, and Schoenberg, weighing Los Angeles&#x2019;s influence on them and their impact on German modernism. Touching on such examples as film noir and Thomas Mann&#x2019;s <i>Doctor Faustus</i>, Bahr shows how this community of exiles reconstituted modernism in the face of the traumatic political and historical changes they were living through.</p><p>"Ehrhard Bahr's sophisticated introduction to the Los Angeles of the �migr�s from Nazi Germany is a quintessential 'Hollywood' book: brilliant in casting, sunny in disposition, with hidden film noir touches.

To Calvin, the only thing that mattered was correcting God's church, which he thought had wandered away from the truth. Throughout his adult life, Calvin manifested a singular passion with God. He desired intensely to subjugate the world to what he saw as God's truth, and his ideas started the movement now known as Calvinism. From Calvin's time, the movement has grown and spread throughout Europe and into North and South America, Africa, and Asia. Today 'New Calvinism' is a major branch of Protestantism. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Jon Balserak explores Calvin's life and considers the major ideas and issues associated with the Calvinist system of thought. He looks at how Calvinist ideas and practices spread and took root, helping shape societies today. Much of contemporary thought - especially western thought - on everything from civil government to money, suicide, and divorce has been influenced by Calvinism. Balserak also combats common misconceptions about Calvinism, and explores the relationship between Calvinism and the modern world.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

A recent &#34;Wall Street Journal&#34; study revealed that the number one most sought after executive skill by organisations is strategic thinking, but few leaders have that skill set. In this book, Rich Horwath dissects the three most important elements of strategic thinking, breaks them down into simple and attainable skills, and shows readers how to apply them every day. He provides managers with a clear path to mastery of three disciplines: Acumen - generate critical insights through a step-by-step evaluation of the business and its environment; Allocation - focus limited resources of time, talent, and money; and, Action - implement a system to guarantee effective execution and communication of strategy throughout the organisation. This book is based on research with senior executives from more than 150 companies and Horwath&#39;s own experience as a professional strategist.

It was originally developed by Professor Den Hartog to meet the needs of engineering students at M.I.T. for a sound yet lucid first course in strength of materials. As such it has also enjoyed wide popularity in engineering schools throughout the world.<br>But the book was remarkable in a number of other ways, so that it has become one of the favorite refresher and reference works for engineers as well as a popular self-study text. Perhaps the chief reason for this is that in addition to all the customary elementary material on the subject (i.e., clear instructions to the fundamentals of tension, torsion, bending, compound stresses, deflection of beams, etc.) it also contains a considerable amount of more advanced material concerning methods of great practical value to working engineers which are not usually included in introductory texts. This material is presented in starred sections (which may be omitted on a first reading without interrupting the flow of the presentation) and includes a full treatment of the Mohr circle and its application to the determination of moments of inertia and strains as well as stresses; a lucid elementary presentation of the theory of the center of shear; and one of the few elementary presentations of the theory of the center of shear; and one of the few elementary discussions of the "Myosotis" method of calculating beam deflections, a method which often possesses considerable advantages over the more usual methods involving moment-area or the differential equation of bending.<br>Other material not usually found in elementary texts but which are frequently of great value to the practicing engineer are the discussions of the statically indeterminate truss, reinforced concrete, plastic deformations, thick-walled cylinders, thick curved bars, Maxwell's Reciprocal Theorem, and photoelasticity.<br>In all sections, both general principles and concrete applications are given. Another feature which readers have found unusually helpful is the 85-page section of 350 problems which gives the student practice in techniques and further illustrates applications. All problems are complete with answers.</p><p><p><b>J. P. Den Hartog: The Reprint Engineer <br></b>J. P. Den Hartog (1901&#x2013;1989), who taught for most of his career at MIT, was one of the founders of the Dover reprint program in engineering. As the author of several books that Dover reprinted and still has in print, and as an advisor from the 1950s until just a few years before his death in 1989, Professor Den Hartog gave invaluable advice concerning books of lasting interest and importance in his field. <br>Not many books in engineering have a productive shelf life spanning several decades. Among the exceptions are these four books of Professor Den Hartog, which Dover reprinted and occasionally revised in later printings from 1961 through 1987: <i>Mechanics,</i> 1961, <i>Strength of Materials,</i> 1961, <i>Mechanical Vibrations,</i> 1985, and <i>Advanced Strength of Materials, </i>1987. Still widely read and cited by authors in these areas, Den Hartog's books are a tribute to his gift for exposition and clarity. <br>The J. P.

Eugenics informed social and scientific policy across the political spectrum, from liberal welfare measures in emerging social-democratic states to feminist ambitions for birth control, from public health campaigns to totalitarian dreams of the "perfectibility of man." This book dispels for uninitiated readers the automatic and apparently exclusive link between eugenics and the Holocaust. It is the first world history of eugenics and an indispensable core text for both teaching and research. Eugenics has accumulated generations of interest as experts attempted to connect biology, human capacity, and policy. In the past and the present, eugenics speaks to questions of race, class, gender and sex, evolution, governance, nationalism, disability, and the social implications of science. In the current climate, in which the human genome project, stem cell research, and new reproductive technologies have proven so controversial, the history of eugenics has much to teach us about the relationship between scientific research, technology, and human ethical decision-making.</p><p><br><strong>Alison Bashford </strong>is Professor of Modern History at the University of Sydney.

And how do our visions of the human shape our theories of social action and institutions? In <em>Moral, Believing Animals</em>, Christian Smith advances a creative theory of human persons and culture that offers innovative, challenging answers to these and other fundamental questions in sociological, cultural, and religious theory.<br><br>Smith suggests that human beings have a peculiar set of capacities and proclivities that distinguishes them significantly from other animals on this planet. Despite the vast differences in humanity between cultures and across history, no matter how differently people narrate their lives and histories, there remains an underlying structure of human personhood that helps to order human culture, history, and narration. Drawing on important recent insights in moral philosophy, epistemology, and narrative studies, Smith argues that humans are animals who have an inescapable moral and spiritual dimension. They cannot avoid a fundamental moral orientation in life and this, says Smith, has profound consequences for how sociology must study human beings.<br></p><p><br>William R.

For some this means poring over records and combing, archives but for many creative writers research happens in the everyday world&#x2014;when they scribble an observation on the subway, when they travel to get the feel for a city, or when they strike up a conversation with an interesting stranger.<br> <br> <i>The Art of Creative Research</i> helps writers take this natural inclination to explore and observe and turn it into a workable&#x2014;and enjoyable&#x2014;research plan. It shows that research shouldn&#x2019;t be seen as a dry, plodding aspect of writing. Instead, it&#x2019;s an art that all writers can master, one that unearths surprises and fuels imagination. This lends authenticity to fiction and poetry as well as nonfiction.<br> <br> Philip Gerard distills the process into fundamental questions: How do you conduct research? And what can you do with the information you gather? He covers both in-person research and work in archives and illustrates how the different types of research can be incorporated into stories, poems, and essays using examples from a wide range of writers in addition to those from his own projects. Throughout, Gerard brings knowledge from his seasoned background into play, drawing on his experiences as a reporter and a writer of both fiction and nonfiction. His enthusiasm for adventure is infectious and will inspire writers to step away from the keyboard and into the world.<br> &#x201c;Research can take you to that golden intersection where the personal meets the public, the private crosses the universal, where the best literature lives,&#x201d; Gerard writes. With his masterly guidance, anyone can become an expert in artful investigation.</p></p><p><b>Philip Gerard</b> is the author of four novels and six books of nonfiction, including<i> Down the Wild Cape Fear: A River Journey through the Heart of North Carolina</i> and <i>The Patron Saint of Dreams</i>.

He teaches in the Department of Creative Writing at the University of North Carolina Wilmington.&#x201c;Gerard fills in a missing part of our thinking about &#x2018;creative writing&#x2019;: how we inform ourselves. In nonfiction in particular, the writer can only write what she knows, and Gerard offers a map for how to get to a place of knowing. The research for artful writing must itself be artful, he says, and extend beyond Google into other kinds of archive. I love and recommend this book.&#x201d; (Ted Conover, author of Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing and Immersion: A Writer&#x2019;s Guide to Going Deep)<br><br>&#x201c;Written in accessible language and filled with anecdotes from a wide range of writers (including Gerard himself), the book takes a subjective, almost holistic approach to the topic of research, presenting the basics with enthusiasm. This makes it ideal reading for college freshman and those new to rigorous research.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Many authors writing a book about research would end it once all of the tips and tricks have been covered. Gerard is to be commended for an approach that, from the very first pages, is sensitive to the fact that the point of all of this research is to produce a piece of writing. He closes the book with craft-focused advice on how to breathe life into the research one has done and translating it onto the page. Writers will find time-honored advice about including sensory details, developing narrative voice, and how to write a scene that one has not witnessed firsthand.&#x201d; (<i>Hippocampus Magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Is it wrong to use the word &#x2018;thrilling&#x2019; for a book about research? Maybe, but as a longtime writing teacher, I am thrilled by the ideas in this book, ideas that push writers away from their small and self-conscious matter and outward into the greater world. Gerard shows us that research and creativity, far from being two opposite poles, are forever intertwined. This book is an inspiring map that leads us into the world of research, a world large enough to hold both romance and hard fact.&#x201d; (David Gessner, author of All the Wild That Remains: Edward Abbey, Wallace Stegner, and the American West)<br><br>&#x201c;What book on research starts with a love song to its subject?

In this major historical application of rational choice theory to a social movement, Dennis Chong reexamines the problem of organizing collective action by focusing on the social, psychological, and moral incentives of political activism that are often neglected by rational choice theorists. Using game theoretic concepts as well as dynamic models, he explores how rational individuals decide to participate in social movements and how these individual decisions translate into collective outcomes. In addition to applying formal modeling to the puzzling and important social phenomenon of collective action, he offers persuasive insights into the political and psychological dynamics that provoke and sustain public activism. This remarkably accessible study demonstrates how the civil rights movement succeeded against difficult odds by mobilizing community resources, resisting powerful opposition, and winning concessions from the government.</p></p><p><b>Dennis Chong</b> is professor of political science at Northwestern University.</p><h2>OCA: Oracle Database 12c Administrator Certified Associate Study Guide: Exams 1Z0-061 and 1Z0-062</h2><p><p><b>An all-in-one study guide prepares you for the updated Oracle Certified Associate certification</b></p> <p>It's been nearly six years since Oracle updated its cornerstone database software, making the demand for a comprehensive study guide for the OCA 12c certification a top priority.

This new research has revolutionized our understanding of the process of change in psychotherapy and in life, and raised a flurry of questions about the practical application of neuroscience in clinical treatment, particularly with those who have experienced early relational trauma and neglect. What insight does neuroscience offer to our clinical understanding of early life experiences? Can we use the plasticity of the brain to aid in therapeutic change? If so, how?<br><br><em>Changing Minds in Therapy</em> explores the dynamics of brain-mind change, translating insights from these new fields of study into practical tips for therapists to use in the consulting room. Drawing from a wide range of clinical approaches and deftly integrating the scholarly with the practical, Margaret Wilkinson presents contemporary neuroscience, as well as attachment and trauma theories, in an accessible way, illuminating the many ways in which cutting edge research may inform clinical practice.</p><p>Margaret Wilkinson maintains a private practice in North Derbyshire, England.

Relating brain, mind and body, in an eminently, accessible account, Wilkinson brings complex theory to life. Thorough research evidence, combined with dramatic case histories, demonstrates how the impact of early trauma may be mediated through attachment and attunement in psychotherapy. This book offers an illuminating, engaging and ultimately, optimistic narrative. I highly recommend; it is an important contribution to the literature.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Professor Joy Schaverien, PhD, Jungian Psychoanalyst in private practice</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Spinoza contended that mind and body are two manifestations of one substance. He recognized that brain and mind are embedded in a body; that brain, mind, and body are continuously affected by each other, as well as by the material and social environment in which they exist, and that acting individuals affect their niches in turn. It has taken the humanities literally ages to realize this essential entanglement and to appreciate that human experience, thought, and behavior can neither be understood nor changed without a deep comprehension of affect. A powerful eye-opener regarding these revived and increasingly researched insights, Wilkinson&#x2019;s work builds on the most important contemporary scientific and clinical efforts to gain a better understanding of relations between parts and wholes.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ellert Nijenhuis, Top Referent Trauma Center Mental Health Care Drenthe, Assen, The Netherlands</strong></p><h2>A Theory of Literary Production (Routledge Classics)</h2><p><p>Who is more important: the reader, or the writer?

It is within us, in the inner citadel that great writers, thinkers, scholars and people of faith have cultivated over the centuries.<br><br> It characterizes our most intimate and sacred spaces, from private bedrooms to grand cathedrals &#x2013; those vast reservoirs of silence. Philosophers and novelists have long sought solitude and inspiration in mountains and forests. Yet despite the centrality of silence to some of our most intense experiences, the transformations of the twentieth century have gradually diminished its value.

An innovative, panoramic reinterpretation of global history, it traces the emergence and development of the modern world from the sixteenth to the twentieth century. This new volume encompasses the nineteenth century from the revolutionary era of 1789 to the First World War. In this crucial period, three great ideologies&#x2015;conservatism, liberalism, and radicalism&#x2015;emerged in response to the worldwide cultural transformation that came about when the French Revolution legitimized the sovereignty of the people. Wallerstein tells how capitalists, and Great Britain, brought relative order to the world and how liberalism triumphed as the dominant ideology.</p><p>&#x201c;Wallerstein is a pleasure to read for his lucid organization of vast materials and his eye for the telling detail. Following a more narrative method than earlier volumes, Volume IV of <i>The Modern World-System</i> is full of clever and surprising turns of interpretation of what might seem the well-worn territory of nineteenth-century ideologies, politics, and movements. Wallerstein shows himself a graceful and accomplished historian as well as grand theoretician of the historical social sciences.

Oxford University Press now presents the most authoritative and comprehensive guide ever published to the philosophy of mind. <br>An outstanding international team of contributors offer 45 specially written critical surveys of a wide range of topics relating to the mind. The first two sections cover the place of the mind in the natural world: its ontological status, how it fits into the causal fabric of the universe, and the nature of consciousness. The third section focuses on the much-debated subjects of content and intentionality. The fourth section examines a variety of mental capacities, including memory, imagination, and emotion. The fifth section looks at epistemic issues, in particular regarding knowledge of one's own and other minds.

Over two volumes, Joachim Whaley rejects the notion that this was a long period of decline, and shows instead how imperial institutions developed in response to the crises of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, notably the Reformation and Thirty Years War. The impact of international developments on the Reich is also examined.<br><br>Volume II begins with the Peace of Westphalia and concludes with the dissolution of the Reich. Whaley analyses the remarkable resurgence of the Reich after the Thirty Years War, which saw the Habsburg emperors achieve a new position of power and influence and which enabled the Reich to withstand the military threats posed by France and the Turks in the later seventeenth century. He gives a rich account of topics such as Pietism and baroque Catholicism, the German enlightenment, and the impact on the Empire and its territories of the French Revolution and Napolean. Whaley emphasizes the continuing viability of the Reich's institutions to the end, and the vitality of a political culture of freedom that has been routinely underestimated by historians of modern Germany.<br></p><p><br><strong>Joachim Whaley</strong> is Senior Lecturer in German, Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages, University of Cambridge.

The editors and an impressive roster of chapter authors from diverse scholarly backgrounds provide detailed information on topics such as discrimination and social exclusion; adverse early life experiences; poor education; unemployment, underemployment, and job insecurity; income inequality, poverty, and neighborhood deprivation; food insecurity; poor housing quality and housing instability; adverse features of the built environment; and poor access to mental health care.This thought-provoking book offers many beneficial features for clinicians and public health professionals: - Clinical vignettes are included, designed to make the content accessible to readers who are primarily clinicians and also to demonstrate the practical, individual-level applicability of the subject matter for those who typically work at the public health, population, and/or policy level.- Policy implications are discussed throughout, designed to make the content accessible to readers who work primarily at the public health or population level and also to demonstrate the policy relevance of the subject matter for those who typically work at the clinical level.- All chapters include five to six key points that focus on the most important content, helping to both prepare the reader with a brief overview of the chapter&#39;s main points and reinforce the &#34;take-away&#34; messages afterward.- In addition to the main body of the book, which focuses on selected individual social determinants of mental health, the volume includes an in-depth overview that summarizes the editors&#39; and their colleagues&#39; conceptualization, as well as a final chapter coauthored by Dr. David Satcher, 16th Surgeon General of the United States, that serves as a &#34;Call to Action,&#34; offering specific actions that can be taken by both clinicians and policymakers to address the social determinants of mental health. The editors have succeeded in the difficult task of balancing the individual/clinical/patient perspective and the population/public health/community point of view, while underscoring the need for both groups to work in a unified way to address the inequities in twenty-first century America. The Social Determinants of Mental Health gives readers the tools to understand and act to improve mental health and reduce risk for mental illnesses for individuals and communities.Students preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) will also benefit from this book, as the MCAT in 2015 will test applicants&#39; knowledge of social determinants of health. The social determinants of mental health are not distinct from the social determinants of physical health, although they deserve special emphasis given the prevalence and burden of poor mental health.</p><p><p>The Social Determinants of Mental Health provides a foundation of knowledge on the social and environmental underpinnings of mental health and mental illnesses for clinical and policy decision making, with a goal to improve the mental health of individuals across diverse communities and the mental health of the nation as a whole. The basic premise of this concise book is that society plays a prominent role in creating and shaping mental illnesses and thus is in a position to improve mental health and reduce risk for mental illnesses. Where an individual, family, community, or society is located on the continuum from health and wellness to illness and infirmity is multidetermined. Although genetic influences and biological factors are key drivers of health and wellness, the contexts of the individual, family, community, and society are also crucial. </p><p>The Social Determinants of Mental Health provides psychiatrists, psychologists, residents, medical students, policymakers, and allied mental health professionals with practical information in an accessible format for incorporating social and environmental determinants of mental health into practice and policy decision making, empowering them to act to build a culture of positive mental health and wellness.</p><p>Students preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) will also benefit from this book, as the MCAT in 2015 will test applicants' knowledge of the social determinants of health.

I. Pankove, RCA.<br>The field of solid state theory, including crystallography, semi-conductor physics, and various applications in chemistry and electrical engineering, is highly relevant to many areas of modern science and industry. Professor Harrison's well-known text offers an excellent one-year graduate course in this active and important area of research. While presenting a broad overview of the fundamental concepts and methods of solid state physics, including the basic quantum theory of solids, it surpasses more theoretical treatments in its practical coverage of physical applications. This feature makes the book especially useful to specialists in other fields who many encounter solid state problems in their own work. At least one year of quantum mechanics is required; however, the author introduces more advanced methods as needed.<br>Because virtually all of the properties of solids are determined by the valence electrons, the author devotes the first third of the book to electron states, including solid types and symmetry, band structure, electron dynamics, the self-consistent-field approximation, energy-band calculations, semi-conductor and semi-metal bands, impurity states, the electronic structure of liquids, and other topics. Dr. Harrison then turns to a more systematic treatment of the electronic properties of solids, focusing on thermodynamic properties, transport properties (including the Boltzmann equation), semi-conductor systems, screening, optical properties, the Landau theory of Fermi liquids, and amorphous semi-conductors. <br>In the final two chapters, Professor Harrison offers a cogent treatment of lattice vibrations and atomic properties and cooperative phenomena (magnetism and superconductivity). In addition to traditional background information, the book features penetrating discussions of such currently active problems as the Mott transition, the electronic structure of disordered systems, tunneling the Kondo effect, and fluctuation near critical points. In an important sense, the entire text constitutes a major vehicle for the clarification of quantum mechanics, resulting from, among other factors, a comparison of the semi-classical (Boltzmann equation) treatment of screening and the corresponding quantum (Liouville equation) treatment.</p><p></p><h2>World War II in Global Perspective, 1931-1953: A Short History (Wiley Short Histories)</h2><p><p><b>A comprehensive review of World War II that offers a global-level analysis</b></p> <p>Written for academics and students of history, <i>World War II in Global Perspective, 1931-1953 </i>presents a dynamic and global account of the historical events prior to, during, and after World War II.

What is uniquely important about this book are the personal stories and viewpoints of proponents and opponents of the Chinese exclusion laws; of Chinese immigrants who posed as &#x201c;paper sons&#x201d; and &#x201c;paper daughters&#x201d; to evade the exclusion laws; and of immigration officials who held strong convictions about how the immigration laws should be enforced.

But the federal mandate of "no child left behind" has come to mean curriculums driven by preparation for standardized tests and quantifiable learning results. Even for very young children, unstructured creative time in the classroom is waning as teachers and administrators are under growing pressures to measure school readiness through rote learning and increased homework. In her new book, Vivian Gussin Paley decries this rapid disappearance of creative time and makes the case for the critical role of fantasy play in the psychological, intellectual, and social development of young children.<br> <br> <i>A Child's Work</i> goes inside classrooms around the globe to explore the stunningly original language of children in their role-playing and storytelling. Drawing from their own words, Paley examines how this natural mode of learning allows children to construct meaning in their worlds, meaning that carries through into their adult lives. Proof that play is the work of children, this compelling and enchanting book will inspire and instruct teachers and parents as well as point to a fundamental misdirection in today's educational programs and strategies.</p></p><p><b>Vivian Gussin Paley</b>, a kindergarten and nursery school teacher for thirty-seven years, primarily at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, has received numerous awards and accolades, including a MacArthur Award and most recently the John Dewey Society's Outstanding Achievement Award. She is the author of eleven books, three of which are published by the University of Chicago Press.&#34;This irresistible book is Vivian Gussin Paley at her very best. Her present inssistence on the necessary relation between a rich variety of fantasy play and intellectual growth is represented as a hard-earned, precious insight, on which she will not negotiate.&#34;</p><h2>Tanglewood Tales, Illustrated Edition (Yesterday&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Sequel to A Wonder Book for Girls and Boys by master storyteller Nathaniel Hawthorne.

Ruth Gomberg-Mu�oz introduces readers to the Lions, ten friends from Mexico committed to improving their fortunes and the lives of their families. Set in and around "Il Vino," a restaurant that could stand in for many places that employ undocumented workers, <em>Labor and Legality </em>reveals the faces behind the war being waged over "illegal aliens" in America. Gomberg-Mu�oz focuses on how undocumented workers develop a wide range of social strategies to cultivate financial security, nurture emotional well-being, and promote their dignity and self-esteem. She also reviews the political and historical circumstances of undocumented migration, with an emphasis on post-1970 socioeconomic and political conditions in the United States and Mexico.<br><br><em>Labor and Legality </em>is one of several volumes in the <strong>Issues of Globalization: Case Studies in Contemporary Anthropology</strong> series, which examines the experiences of individual communities in our contemporary world.

In response, theology has tried to legitimate itself by building upon social scientific conclusions. In this acclaimed book, John Milbank suggests that both enterprises are compromised by the theological and anti-theological assumptions built into the social sciences themselves. <br> <p>This new edition of <i>Theology and Social Theory</i> brings John Milbank&#x2019;s classic work fully into line with his most recent views and is laid out in an easier-to-read format. It features a substantial new preface in which Milbank answers his critics by defending and further elaborating his metahistorical vision.<br> </p> <p>Provocative and well-argued, this updated classic from one of the world&#x2019;s leading theologians offers a comprehensive treatment of the relation between theology and social theory, all the way from Plato to Deleuze.<br> </p><b>John Milbank</b> is Professor of Religion, Politics and Ethics at the University of Nottingham and one of the most influential contemporary theologians.

It presents a simple yet highly effective research strategy that prepares students to efficiently solve the types of complex legal-research problems they can expect to encounter in the workplace. The book includes a section of tips on how to avoid common research pitfalls, as well as a Trouble-Shooting Guide to help students overcome the occasional obstacles that may crop up in their research projects. For these reasons, the book makes an ideal stand-alone text for the first-year legal-research class, as well as an excellent supplementary text for advanced legal-research classes.</p><p></p><h2>A Sumerian Chrestomathy: With the Collaboration of Silvano Votto and Jessica Baldwin (Subsidia Et Instrumenta Linguarum Orientis)</h2><p>A Sumerian Chrestomathy by Konrad Volk has been written for beginners studying Sumerian within the academic curriculum. The volume contains 44 texts of varying contents: royal inscriptions, legal, and economic documents dating from the Early Dynastic (ca. 2500 B.C.) to the Old Babylonian Period (ca. 1750 B.C.) when Sumerian was no longer a spoken language. Some of the autographed texts are accompanied by a version in Neo-Assyrian script so that the student can learn the Neo-Assyrian sign forms which are of fundamental importance for the use of the sign list in this book and, in general, for most Assyriological sign lists. Each inscription can be studied with the help of the sign list, which is intentionally limited to the signs that occur in this book. Reference is given to the most recent works in the field by R. Borger and C. Mittermayer. Also included are individual and detailed glossaries: General Vocabulary; Divine Names; Personal Names; Place Names; Sacred Buildings; Year Dates; Year Names; Festivals. These glossaries not only quote the lexical items found in the inscriptions but also give the Akkadian equivalents for Sumerian words and refer - wherever necessary - to the most recent Sumerological literature.</p><p></p><h2>Recreational Therapy and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health</h2><p><br>The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) from the World Health Organization represents a major shift in healthcare. It looks at health, not from the perspective of disease, disorder, or injury, but from the perspective of how a person s health fits in with the rest of his or her life, the kinds of things the person does, and the environment the person lives in. This is what recreational therapists have been saying all along.<br>Recreational Therapy and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health was written to bring together the ideas that are already well understood in recreational therapy practice and the model of healthcare represented by the ICF. If recreational therapists take the time to understand and use the ICF, they will find it is an excellent tool for improving practice and demonstrating the importance of the work they do.<br>This book includes all of the codes in the 2016 version of the ICF. There is an overview of each of the ICF s four sections, Body Functions, Body Structure, Activities and Participation, and Environmental Factors, plus a description of Personal Factors. The purpose and scoring of each section are described with recreational therapy examples. Each chapter in the four sections is covered in more detail with a description of the code set, more detailed scoring examples, an assessment overview, and treatment directions. An evidence review demonstrates the efficacy of treating each set of codes.<br>For each code, the book provides the full text of the code, describes the code s relevance to recreational therapy practice, explains the assessment process and how to score the code, introduces the reader to code-related treatment directions and adaptations, and cross references the code to the other two books in this series (Recreational Therapy for Specific Diagnoses and Conditions and Recreational Therapy Basics, Techniques, and Interventions).<br></p><p><br>Heather Porter is a faculty member in the Rehabilitation Sciences Department at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA.

Most notably, she coordinates an annual Recreational Therapy Evidence-Based Practice Conference and maintains an open-access database for recreational therapy research and resources that has been utilized by over 60 countries. Dr. Porter also provides consultations to recreational therapy academic programs on how to integrate evidence-based research into coursework, and is recognized as a leader in the community seeking to integrate the World Health Organization s International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health into healthcare practice.<br></p><h2>Close Reader Student Edition Grade 12 (Collections)</h2><p>Collections: Close Reader Student Edition Grade 12</p><p></p><h2>Thieves of Book Row: New York&#39;s Most Notorious Rare Book Ring and the Man Who Stopped It</h2><p>No one had ever tried a caper like this before. The goods were kept in a secure room under constant scrutiny, deep inside a crowded building with guards at the exits. The team picked for the job included two old hands known only as Paul and Swede, but all depended on a fresh face, a kid from Pinetown, North Carolina. In the Depression, some fellows were willing to try anything -- even a heist in the rare book room of the New York Public Library.<br><br>In <em>Thieves of Book Row,</em> Travis McDade tells the gripping tale of the worst book-theft ring in American history, and the intrepid detective who brought it down. Author of <em>The Book Thief</em> and a curator of rare books, McDade transforms painstaking research into a rich portrait of Manhattan's Book Row in the 1920s and '30s, where organized crime met America's cultural treasures in dark and crowded shops along gritty Fourth Avenue. Dealers such as Harry Gold, a tough native of the Lower East Side, became experts in recognizing the value of books and recruiting a pool of thieves to steal them -- many of them unemployed men who drifted up the Bowery or huddled around fires in Central Park's shantytowns. When Paul and Swede brought a new recruit into his shop, Gold trained him for the biggest score yet: a first edition of Edgar Allan Poe's <em>Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems.</em> Gold's recruit cased the rare-book room for weeks, searching for a weakness. When he found one, he struck, leading to a breathtaking game of wits between Gold and NYPL special investigator G. William Bergquist. <br><br>Both a fast-paced, true-life thriller, <em>Thieves of Book Row</em> provides a fascinating look at the history of crime and literary culture.<br></p><p><br><strong>Travis McDade</strong> is the author of<em> The Book Thief: The True Crimes of Daniel Spiegelman </em>and the curator of rare books at the University of Illinois College of Law. He teaches a class at the University of Illinois called "Rare Books, Crime &amp; Punishment."<br><br>"<em>Thieves</em> is an engaging cat-and-mouse account of porous libraries, scouts armed with 'gall, confidence, and oversized coats,' complicit salesmen and of G. William Bergquist, the dogged New York Public Library investigator who cracked the gang's most audacious caper: the theft in 1931 of first editions of <em>The Scarlet Letter, Moby-Dick</em> and a rare Edgar Allan Poe collection." --<em>New York Times</em><p></p><br>"McDade does a superb job of drawing a complete picture of the environment in which the Romm Gang operated. McDade makes a smart choice to spin his tale around the mostly forgotten individuals who participated in a widespread scheme to steal library books." --<em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br>"McDade's account is a better-informed account of [thief Harry] Gold than those in other sometimes misty-eyed and less hard-nosed portraits of Book Row. By concentrating on just a few men, McDade not only avoids many pitfalls in writing about the trade more generally, but also manages to bring this tale chronologically to a conclusion. It is not a very satisfactory conclusion, for this book raises larger questions: pointing a moral as well as adorning a tale." --<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"Definitive history.... a fantastically colorful cast of characters and rich period detail will hook book lovers and historians of N.Y.C." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"A compelling history. Rich in characterization and vividly set, this tale of Manhattan's Fourth Avenue, known then as 'Book Row,' and its bookleggers makes for grand reading." --<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"With wit, erudition, and a nice sense of timing, McDade recreates the seamy side of the antiquarian book business in Depression-era New York and Boston. This immensely engaging story will appeal to cultural historians, literary scholars, bibliophiles, and true-crime lovers alike." --Joan Shelley Rubin, Professor of History, University of Rochester and author of <em>Songs of Ourselves: The Uses of Poetry in America</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Thieves of Book Row</em> chronicles a fascinating chapter in the history of the book trade, libraries, and organized crime.

But by the early 1990s, the organization they founded, ACT UP, was no more&#x2014;even as the AIDS epidemic raged on. Weaving together interviews with activists, extensive research, and reflections on the author&#x2019;s time as a member of the organization, <i>Moving Politics</i> is the first book to chronicle the rise and fall of ACT UP, highlighting a key factor in its trajectory: emotion.</p> <p>Surprisingly overlooked by many scholars of social movements, emotion, Gould argues, plays a fundamental role in political activism. From anger to hope, pride to shame, and solidarity to despair, feelings played a significant part in ACT UP&#x2019;s provocative style of protest, which included raucous demonstrations, die-ins, and other kinds of street theater. Detailing the movement&#x2019;s public triumphs and private setbacks, <i>Moving Politics</i> is the definitive account of ACT UP&#x2019;s origin, development, and decline as well as a searching look at the role of emotion in contentious politics.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><b>Deborah B. Gould</b> is assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.&#34;Moving Politics is not just a rich and rigorous history of ACT UP.

How have humans constructed these concepts? And once they have been constructed by adults, how do children acquire them? While primarily focusing on the second question, in The Origin of Concepts , Susan Carey shows that the answers to both overlap substantially.<br><br>Carey begins by characterizing the innate starting point for conceptual development, namely systems of core cognition. Representations of core cognition are the output of dedicated input analyzers, as with perceptual representations, but these core representations differ from perceptual representations in having more abstract contents and richer functional roles. Carey argues that the key to understanding cognitive development lies in recognizing conceptual discontinuities in which new representational systems emerge that have more expressive power than core cognition and are also incommensurate with core cognition and other earlier representational systems. Finally, Carey fleshes out Quinian bootstrapping, a learning mechanism that has been repeatedly sketched in the literature on the history and philosophy of science. She demonstrates that Quinian bootstrapping is a major mechanism in the construction of new representational resources over the course of childrens cognitive development.<br><br>Carey shows how developmental cognitive science resolves aspects of long-standing philosophical debates about the existence, nature, content, and format of innate knowledge. She also shows that understanding the processes of conceptual development in children illuminates the historical process by which concepts are constructed, and transforms the way we think about philosophical problems about the nature of concepts and the relations between language and thought.<br></p><p><br>Susan Carey is a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. She is a renowned expert on conceptual development and is known for introducing the concept of fast mapping, whereby children learn the meanings of words after a single exposure, and for integrating work on conceptual change in the history of science with work on conceptual change in childhood.<br>Anyone with the slightest interest in the nature of mathematics should give [Carey] serious study. * James Robert Brown and James Davies, Philosophical Quarterly *</p><h2>Capitalism and Classical Social Theory, Third Edition</h2><p><p>In this third edition of <i>Capitalism and Classical Social Theory</i>, John Bratton and David Denham build on the classical triumvirate&#x2014;Karl Marx, �mile Durkheim, and Max Weber&#x2014;by extending the conversation to include early female theorists such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, as well as the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois and G.H.

This revised and expanded third edition features topical discussions of socio-economic shifts in the post-Trump and post-Brexit world and uses original excerpts and additional readings to further contextualize the significance of classical social theory today.</p></p><p><b>John Bratton</b> is a visiting professor at both Edinburgh Napier University and the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, in the UK.<br> <b>David Denham</b> is an honorary research fellow at the University of Wolverhampton in the UK, where he taught a wide variety of sociology courses over a career of 35 years.<br><p><strong>Preface</strong></p><br><p>Since the second edition of this book, we have witnessed seismic social-economic and political changes that have reverberated worldwide. For North America, the UK, and Europe, these changes seem to have engendered a sense of crisis&#x2014;a sense of impending war, terrorist attacks, political turmoil with popular insurrections and riots, racism, xenophobia, and general foreboding as health provisions are commodified or scaled back. That&#x2019;s not all. Technological acceleration has transformed our planet, our societies, and ourselves. The surfeit of well-documented reports link climate change to human activity and provide irrefutable evidence of an ecological crisis. The replacement of human labor power by robotic production and artificial-intelligence systems points to &#x201c;jobless growth,&#x201d; threatening the last vestiges of job security in manual and core professional occupations. Digital technologies are complicit in the transformational challenges we face today. It is possible for workers to be engaged, surveilled, and managed by text messages. Digital platforms harvest our personal tastes and preferences, which are sold to commercial advertisers and political lobbying groups. Data are the key resource of twenty-first-century capitalism&#x2014;as crucial as coal, electricity, and oil in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries&#x2014;creating global giants such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple (the first trillion-dollar corporation) with immense corporate power.</p><br><p>Have we experienced a period of crisis before? There have indeed been other dramatic years of rupture and uncertainty, such as 1926, when the British Trades Union Congress called a general strike that led the national government to mobilize the army; 1968, when police and the National Guard with fixed bayonets clashed with protestors against the Vietnam war on the streets of Chicago, and students and workers rioted on the streets of Paris; 1979, when the Berlin Wall came down; 1994, when elections in South Africa led to a coalition government, marking the official end of the apartheid system; 2008, when the global financial crisis, triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, shook the world; and 2011, when we witnessed the pro-democracy revolts in North Africa and the Arab world, the short-lived anti-capitalist Occupy movement, and the environmental disaster caused by severe damage to the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan. Since 2014, we have witnessed the election of an ex-TV celebrity star, Donald Trump, as President of the United States; the United Kingdom voted to sever its 44-year membership in the European Union&#x2014;the so-called Brexit; and, in an age of unprecedented migration of people, there have been election gains for alt-right politicians across Europe including the UK, France, Germany, Hungary, and Poland.</p><br><p>There are some parallels between the election of Trump and the surprising Brexit result in that in both countries a large swathe of voters, often white working class, were discontent with the status quo. These voters felt increasingly insecure&#x2014;left behind by economic globalization and socially marginalized by neoliberal welfare policies&#x2014;and had lost faith in mainstream politicians meant to serve them. Economically depressed &#x201c;rust belt&#x201d; manufacturing and coal-mining regions and mid-American states voted for Trump, just as the post-industrial towns in the north of England, Wales, and rural England voted heavily to leave the European Union. Seven of the poorest ten regions in Northern Europe are in England. All seven had substantial Brexit majorities. In 2016, Barack Obama attributed the two electoral earthquakes partly to social dislocations that have resulted from a rapidly changing world: &#x201c;Globalization combined with technology combined with social media and constant information have disrupted people&#x2019;s lives, sometimes in very concrete ways ... A manufacturing plant closes, and suddenly an entire town no longer has what was the primary source of employment ... making people less certain of their national identities or their place in the world.&#x201d; The election of Trump and the EU referendum result have left the US and Britain acutely divided by age, class, gender, and education. These social fissures are not new but reflect the consequences of post-1990 economic globalization and neoliberal ideology.</p><br><p>Added to this cauldron of uncertainty and social turmoil is the phenomenon of post-factual politics and &#x201c;fake news&#x201d; written and disseminated through social media with the intent to mislead in order to damage an entity or politician, and/or gain political advantage. Social media platforms and global-spanning corporations have challenged the traditional sources and centers of authority as never before across the developed world. Even in the age of Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook, the argument of this book is that the classical social thinkers speak to the present as much as the past. We shall attempt to illustrate the startlingly contemporary relevance of the classical analysis of capital&#x2019;s crisis-generation modus operandi and its ever-expanding destruction of industrial jobs and the planetary environment.</p><br><p>In the second edition, we made reference to the profound changes in global capitalism and in perspectives that have taken place, which affect the way that modernity has been studied over the last three decades. Changes in the condition of modernity include the ascendancy of neoliberalism, the emergence of new major economic players such as the People&#x2019;s Republic of China, India, and Brazil, and the all-pervasive diffusion of labor-saving digital technology. And, in addition to movements of capital and goods, the mass migration of people to Western Europe and North America has made multiculturalism, the politics of equality, and managing diversity in organizations major areas of research. A key issue for social scientists is the effect of globalization on the workplace, society, and beyond. An important theme in the literature is convergence in capitalism, which affects production and employment practices in different regions of the world. The convergence debate has a long antecedence in neoclassical economic theory. Detractors, however, emphasize the existence of &#x201c;varieties of capitalism&#x201d; and divergence in capitalist behavior as evidence of the importance of the power of local culture, politics, and agency. Over the last 40 years, sociologists have witnessed the ascendancy of rival intellectual approaches to the study of social phenomena. For example, under the rubric of postmodernism, the traditional approach to researching aspects of society, loosely described as positivism, has been challenged by constructionism and intersectionality. The constructivist&#x2019;s view challenges researchers to re-examine their frames of reference, the research process itself, and the production of knowledge. The concept of intersectionality has been utilized by social scientists as an analytical and organizing tool for investigating social injustices and developing social policy. It has been defined in various ways, but this inspirational description points toward a general consensus:</p><br><p>Intersectionality is a way of understanding and analyzing the complexity in the world, in people, and in human experiences. The events and conditions of social and political life and the self can seldom be understood as shaped by one factor. They are generally shaped by many factors in diverse and mutually influencing ways. When it comes to social inequality, people&#x2019;s lives and the organization of power in a given society are better understood as being shaped not by a single axis of social division, be it race or gender or class, but by many axes that work together and influence each other. Intersectionality as an analytic tool gives people better access to the complexity of the world and of themselves. Importantly, the postmodern approach, as Eagleton and Lyotard notably argue, eschews meta-narratives such as Marx&#x2019;s conception of history, whose function was to legitimize the illusion of a universal human history, and celebrates the triumph of local fragmented specificities over any kind of totality.<br>In this intellectual climate, inevitably, there will be disagreement among contemporary sociologists over which classical social theorist should be included in a text on classical theory. The membership of the classical canon is important, for the canon provides a shared language, a focus, some kind of identity for the discipline, and it shapes both the intellectual discourse and the trajectory of social research. In the first edition of Capitalism and Classical Social Theory, we chose to be more inclusive and extended the coverage of the familiar sociological canon established around the 1970s&#x2014;that is, the trio of Marx, Durkheim, and Weber&#x2014;to include the German sociologist Georg Simmel and four women intellectuals who theorized about gender roles, gendered work, and new patterns of family life that were the consequences of the emergence of industrial capitalism. Our choice was influenced by a common criticism of the classical canon: the marginalization of gender in its authors&#x2019; theories. We examined the gendering of social theory in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries through the work of Mary Wollstonecraft, Harriet Martineau, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Jane Addams.<br></p></p><h2>Deviance: Social Constructions and Blurred Boundaries</h2><p><i>Deviance: Social Constructions and Blurred Boundaries</i> draws on up-to-date scholarship across a wide spectrum of deviance categories, providing a symbolic interactionist analysis of the deviance process. The book addresses positivistic theories of deviant behavior within a description of the deviance process that encompasses the work of deviance claims-makers, rule-breakers, and social control agents.<br> &nbsp;<br> Students:&nbsp;<br><ul><li>are&nbsp;introduced to the sociology of&nbsp;deviance</li><li>learn to analyze several kinds of criminal&nbsp;deviance&nbsp;that involve unwilling victims&#x2014;such as murder, rape, street-level property crime, and white-collar crime</li><li>learn to examine several categories of &#x201c;lifestyle&#x201d; and &#x201c;status&#x201d;&nbsp;deviance</li><li>develop skills for critical analysis of criminal justice and social policies</li></ul>Overall, students gain an understanding of the sociology of deviance through cross-cultural comparisons, historical overview of deviance in the U.S., and up-close analysis of the lived experience of those who are labeled deviant as well as responses to them in the U.S. today.<br><br> Instructor Resources are available to easily help with lecture and exam preparation.&nbsp;<br></p><p><i>Deviance: Social Constructions and Blurred Boundaries</i> is an engaging textbook that&#x2014;as opposed to the mainstream approach of getting lost in the details&#x2014;emphasizes the big, fundamental questions and approaches, and does so in a manner that is both intelligent and accessible. Study and review questions in the text are important&#x2014;in terms of appropriate description and analysis. The structure of the textbook itself serves much the same purpose&#x2014; students need ample reinforcement of key ideas. -- Richard Taradancino, Professor of Global and Sociocultural Studies, Florida International University<br><br>The teaching of deviance always seems to border on the voyeuristic in many texts. Anderson has done a great job avoiding that here. The material presented in the textbook will be accessible to undergraduates. It has the potential to generate good discussions in the classroom. Additionally, I enjoyed how Anderson addresses the topics in a way that isn&#x2019;t blindly critical of the hegemonic images of the body in our culture but at the same time doesn&#x2019;t take them for granted. -- Jack Spencer, Professor of Sociology, Purdue University&nbsp;<b>Leon Anderson</b> is Professor of Sociology at Utah State University.

My hero has actually achieved the majesty of his own quarterdeck, and his life will never be the same again. It may seem an improbable transformation of a young perruquier of Guildford, press ganged into His Majesty&#39;s Navy less than ten years before, but the historical record tells us that there were Thomas Kydds, not many admittedly, but enough to be tantalising to a writer&#39;s imagination. The great age of fighting sail was a time of huge contrasts and often harsh conditions, but at least in the Royal Navy then, it was conceivable for a young man of talent and ambition to rise far above his station. I do remember my feelings when I became an officer, having begun my sea career on the lower deck. And sometimes I idly wonder, had I lived back then, could I have been a Tom Kydd?Thomas Kydd takes command of his own ship--now he will learn first hand about the power and loneliness that comes with ultimate responsibility. <p>In this seventh book of the series, Thomas Kydd has his own command at last: the brig-sloop <i>Teazer!</i> But Kydd must race the clock to make her battle ready to defend Malta against Barbary pirates and the French who are frantically trying to rescue the remnants of their army in the Levant. Then peace is suddenly declared, and the young captain finds himself ashore on half pay. To make ends meet, he agrees to transport convicts to Australia.

As the literary critic George Steiner has remarked, &#34;the age of the Gulag and of Auschwitz, of famine and ubiquitous torture ... nuclear threat, the ecological laying waste of our planet, the leap of endemic, possibly pandemic, illness out of the very matrix of libertarian progress&#34; is exactly what Joesph de Maistre foretold. In the Dialogues Maistre addressed a number of topics that are discussed briefly or not at all in his other works already available in English. These include an apologetic for traditional Christian beliefs about providence, reflections on the social role of the public executioner and the &#34;divinity&#34; of war, a critique of John Locke&#39;s sensationalist psychology, meditations on prayer and sacrifice, and a mini-course on &#34;illuminism.&#34; The literary form is that of the &#34;philosophical conversation&#34; - one that allowed Maistre to be deliberately provocative and to indulge his taste for paradox, a &#34;methodical extravagance&#34; that he judged particularly appropriate for the eighteenth-century salon. Translator and editor Richard Lebrun provides a full scholarly edition of this classic work, complete with an introduction, chronology, critical bibliography, and generous explanatory notes.

His lifetime coincided with a crucial point in Egyptian history, following the ill-starred religious revolution of Akhenaten, and heralding the last phase of Egypt&#x2019;s imperial splendor. As the second scion of a wholly new royal family, his reign did much to set the agenda for the coming decades, both at home and abroad. Sethy was also a great builder, apparently with exquisite artistic taste, to judge from the unique quality of the decoration of his celebrated monuments at Abydos and Thebes. This richly illustrated book tells the story of Sethy's career and monuments, not only in ancient times, but in modern history, and the impact of his legacy on today&#x2019;s understanding and appreciation of ancient Egypt.</p><p>Aidan Dodson is a senior research fellow in the Department of Anthropology and Archaeology at the University of Bristol, UK, where he teaches Egyptology.

Vogel, one of the most widely read scholars on Asian affairs, provides a comprehensive explanation of East Asia&#x2019;s industrial breakthrough. While others have attributed this success to tradition or to national economic policy, Vogel&#x2019;s penetrating analysis illuminates how cultural background interacted with politics, strategy, and situational factors to ignite the greatest burst of sustained economic growth the world has yet seen.</p><p>Vogel describes how each of the four little dragons acquired the political stability needed to take advantage of the special opportunities available to would-be industrializers after World War II. He traces how each little dragon devised a structure and a strategy to hasten industrialization and how firms acquired the entrepreneurial skill, capital, and technology to produce internationally competitive goods. Vogel brings masterly insight to the underlying question of why Japan and the little dragons have been so extraordinarily successful in industrializing while other developing countries have not. No other work has pinpointed with such clarity how institutions and cultural practices rooted in the Confucian tradition were adapted to the needs of an industrial society, enabling East Asia to use its special situational advantages to respond to global opportunities.</p><p>This is a book that all scholars and lay readers with an interest in Asia will want to read and ponder.</p></p><p>Ezra F. Vogel is the author of numerous books on Japan and China, including <i>Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China</i> (Harvard), which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography, winner of the Lionel Gelber Prize, and a Best Book of the Year in the <i>Economist</i>, <i>Financial Times</i>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>Washington Post</i>. It was also a <i>New York Times</i> Editors&#x2019; Choice and a <i>Gates Notes</i> Top Read. Vogel is the author of the classic work <i>Japan as Number One</i> (Harvard), whose Japanese edition topped the bestseller list there for many years. He is Henry Ford II Professor of the Social Sciences, Emeritus, at Harvard University.&#x201c;[Vogel] explains how government and industry have interacted in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, turning charity case nations into business school case studies.

Since he has already written big books about the Japanese accomplishment and the unfolding capitalist miracle in Guangdong, this work is really part of a continuing series of studies that have given us a fairly complete picture of what modern East Asia is all about. Here, his empirical descriptions are brief, but he manages to include broad comparisons that tie his arguments neatly together... This readable, concise book ought to be required reading for all economists, for all theorists of development, for all politicians who want to understand the rudiments of what makes some societies healthy and others not, and for those engaged in business anywhere in the world where East Asian products are important.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Daniel Chirot</b><b>, </b><b><i>Contemporary Sociology</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;What a ride it&#x2019;s been for East Asians, and Vogel captures nicely, in conversational prose, the highlights of the Pacific Rim&#x2019;s 40-year march to industrial greatness in sectors as different as shipbuilding and textiles.

There's a cop named Jamie Breck, and he's dirty. The problem is, no one can prove it.

Winner of an Edgar Award and the recipient of a Gold Dagger for fiction and the Chandler-Fulbright Award, he lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, with his wife and their two sons.*Starred Review* In the wake of Exit Music (2008), the concluding volume in his celebrated John Rebus series,Rankin has picked a most unlikely new hero. Edinburgh cop Malcolm Fox works for &#x201c;the Complaints,&#x201d; the despised internal-affairs division whose job it is to investigate other cops. Succeeding the Rebus novels, starring the quintessential maverick copper, with a series built around a cop-hunting cop seems akin to J. K. Rowling following Harry Potter with seven extra-thick novels about a classroom tattletale. And, yet, Rankin pulls it off, making Fox the fall guy in an elaborate police conspiracy and causing him to join forces with a detective under suspicion of peddling child porn. The strange-bedfellows angle drives the interpersonal dynamics here&#x2014;and augurs well for future installments&#x2014;as Fox, working off the books, investigates the murder of someone very close to home and attempts to turn the frame-up on its end. Some crime writers keep writing the same series with different characters, but Rankin deserves credit for going another way altogether. Fox is a good and quiet citizen compared to Rebus (he doesn&#x2019;t drink and listens to birdsong on the radio, not classic rock), but Rankin doesn&#x2019;t hold any of that against his new hero, proving that you can build complex, highly textured, series-worthy characters from the most unlikely of raw materials. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: A new series from the internationally best-selling Rankin is very big news in the mystery world, and his publisher will spread the word in every conceivable way&#x2014;even including transit ads in New York and San Francisco. --Bill Ott</p><h2>Complicated Watches and Their Repair</h2><p>Dealing with a complicated watch used to be a rare job for the watch repairer, but with the popularity of the automatic, it is almost commonplace. Furthermore, the increased interest in calendar work, alarm watches, and chronographs will undoubtedly bring more and more complicated work into the workshop. This book deals with complicated work essentially from the repairer&#39;s point of view. The action of each mechanism is briefly and clearly described, dismantling and assembly instructions are given, as well as oiling charts and hints on fault-finding and their rectification.</p><p>Donald de Carle was a Fellow and Medallist of the British Horological Institute and a Freeman of the City of London by virtue of being a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers.

He contributed to the Encyclopaedia Britannica and was the author of many other horological works including Clock and Watch Repairing, Watch and Clock Encyclopaedia, The Watchmaker&#39;s and Model Engineer&#39;s Lathe and Practical Watch Adjusting.

She's lived through horrors that still give her nightmares. But nothing in Bailey's life-or-death training prepared her for caring for the tiny terror that is five-year-old Olivia Hale. Or how to control her raging attraction to Olivia's father, Streeter, the rugged, green-eyed cattle rancher who undermines her every move even when he stars in her dreams. <br><br> Streeter Hale has room for only two things in his life: his daughter and his job. He doesn't date. He doesn't get attached. Not anymore. So not only is Streeter stunned by Olivia's improved behavior after just a few days with Bailey, he's downright floored by his immediate attraction to the woman. But with secrets in her eyes and a body that doesn't quit, Streeter begins to worry that Bailey Masterson might just be the one woman to heal his fractured family and broken heart.<br><br> One thing's for sure--these two wrecked souls are spinning out of control as they desperately try not to fall in love...</p><p><b>Lorelei James</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>USA Today&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of contemporary romances set in the modern-day Wild West, as well as the bestselling Need You and Mastered series.<p>Chapter One</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I quit."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No no no no no no no, not again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Streeter Hale practically had to run after his babysitter as she hoofed it away from the house. "Please wait just a minute, Mrs. McCutcheon, I'm sure we can find a better way to deal with-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That was all he got out before she whirled around so fast he nearly plowed into her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm done. That's it. I've tried. I've failed. Good luck finding a replacement caregiver. You'll need it since I was your last option at the agency." Through gritted teeth she said, "That child . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don't you dare say it. I swear I will lose my shit if you call my daughter something like the devil's spawn or a demon child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That child . . . what?" he said tersely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That child needs a firmer hand." She raised her chin and glared at him. "I have forty years of childcare experience. In addition to running a daycare and a preschool for twenty-five years, I have four children of my own and ten grandchildren. In those forty years I've never let a child best me. Never. Congratulations. Your five-year-old daughter did what so many others before her tried and failed to do: made me want to quit."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Streeter locked eyes with the older woman, who was a dead ringer for Mrs. Doubtfire. "Can I ask what Olivia did this time?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The fact you had to tack on 'this time' is the biggest indicator that there is a problem, Mr. Hale. It wasn't one action, although her drum solo on pots and pans was the final straw."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She harrumphed. "Olivia should be apologizing, not you. Stop letting her use her mother's death as an excuse to misbehave-she's not the only child who's lost a parent. Besides, she's five years old, for crying out loud. She'll be starting kindergarten in the fall. The teacher won't put up with her tantrums or her backtalking or her manipulations. And you shouldn't either."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why don't you tell me how you really feel?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But she wasn't the first person who'd told him that. With her being the sixth childcare provider who'd quit in the past eighteen months . . . he had to admit something had to change. "Thank you for your advice, Mrs. McCutcheon."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She sent him a look that said she didn't believe he'd take it. She shrugged and continued her escape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Streeter took several deep breaths. Then he counted to ten slowly, six times, before he headed into his house.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer was completely quiet, but the place was a total wreck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He said, "Olivia. Come out here."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No response.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Louder, he said, "Now. I mean it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The crocheted afghan on the back of the sofa cushion moved against the paneled wall and he watched his daughter crawl out from behind the tweed couch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kid was like a little mouse, squeezing into the tightest spaces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her super fine blond hair nearly stood on end from static electricity. His eyes narrowed on her clothing. Not what he'd dressed her in when he'd left the house two hours ago. She'd donned her one-piece mermaid swimsuit, pairing it with her Frozen Elsa leggings, the plaid satin Christmas skirt from last year and a beaded metal necklace. His heart stopped as he imagined that necklace getting caught in the loose threads on the back of the couch and choking her. Not to mention the fact she'd somehow gotten into his closet where he'd stashed her mother's costume jewelry-an area he'd warned her multiple times was off-limits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pick your battles. Do not give in to your fear by becoming angry and yelling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That was hard as hell when his little spitfire looked at him defiantly and said, "What?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You know what." He pointed to the time-out chair. "Park it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But, Daddy-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Right now, Olivia Joyce."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her blue eyes widened. He only pulled out her middle name when she was in deep shit. She dramatically flopped in the chair like a disgusted teen. Tough for a five-year-old to pull off, but she managed it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Tell me what happened with Mrs. McCutcheon today."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"She made me sit at the table and color." Her freckled nose wrinkled. "I told her I wanted to play the drums. She said no and when she went to the bathroom I got all the stuff out because she was in there a really really really long time."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And?" he prompted again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her bare feet began to swing beneath the chair. "And when she finally came out, she told me to stop beatin' on the pans."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Did you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She shook her head. "Then she tried to make me stop, but it's not my fault she tripped over my jump rope and fell down."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Streeter pinned her with a look. "Where was the jump rope, Olivia?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Umm . . . I tied it between a chair leg and the cupboard door handle."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Like a booby trap?" he demanded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She frowned. "A what?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"A hidden trap."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, yeah, 'cept it wasn't really hidden. I was just tryin' to keep her from comin' into the kitchen and stopping my drum practice."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He deeply regretted letting her watch that Drumline movie a few months back; she'd been obsessed with turning everything into a percussion instrument ever since. "Regardless. Who was in charge?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Mrs. McC."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And if she told you no . . . what were you supposed to do?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Olivia crossed her arms over her chest. "Listen to her and do what she says."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And you didn't."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's my house, Daddy. Why won't she ever let me do what I want to do in my own house?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We've talked about this a hundred times, Olivia. You are not the adult. You are not in charge. You don't make the rules. You follow the rules set by the adults. All the rules. All the time."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Even if the rules are dumb?" she countered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes." Streeter removed his cowboy hat and ran his hand through his sweaty hair. "And now I've had to take time off from work. So get your boots on, girlie, because we're leavin'."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Mrs. McC isn't waitin' outside until you're done setting me straight?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Good lord. The mouth and the brain on this girl. "No. She quit."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh." Olivia slumped in the chair. "She smelled weird anyway."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His brain cautioned him not to ask, but his mouth was already moving. "What do you mean by weird?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"She smelled mean."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"How do you know what mean smells like?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Because it smells like her."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Okay, then. "Get movin'. I don't wanna hear any complaints about you havin' a peanut butter sandwich for lunch again today."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm comin' to work with you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Streeter stopped halfway to the kitchen and looked back at her. "Where else did you think you were gonna go?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Olivia hopped off the chair. "To Aunt Jade's house."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"She just had baby Micah two months ago, sweetheart. She's busy with him and your cousin Amber."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But I could help her!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His sweet sister-in-law Jade was on the very short list of people who could handle Olivia on a regular basis. But he'd been careful not to overstep his bounds with his brother's wife, asking too much of her when it came to taking care of his daughter-even before Jade had two kids under age two.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I would follow all the rules for her. I always do. Please, Daddy? I'll be good. I promise."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He had a lightbulb moment. "Is that what this has been about? You actin' up so Mrs. McC quits and you expecting that I'll let you stay with Jade instead?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She looked guilty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Olivia, that ain't how things work. You know it. Now while I'm makin' your lunch, grab something to do in the truck 'cause you're gonna be in there a few hours."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hours?" she repeated with horror. "What am I s'posed to do for that long?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Bring your coloring stuff."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Boring," she said with a sniff. "Can I play with your phone?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No." Maybe his smile was a little insincere when he said, "Or you could always practice your drumming on the dashboard."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>i</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Later that night, while Olivia watched a movie, Streeter scoured Craigslist for potential daycare options. With Olivia signed up for a half a day at the Learning Center in Casper, and a full day at the upcoming Split Rock Summer Day Camp, he only needed in-home daycare three days a week. Surely there had to be high school or college students looking for a part-time summer job. Without the agency fees tacked on he could afford to pay four bucks an hour more than the standard rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He followed link after link until his vision went blurry and his frustration mounted. As he was about to give up, he saw an ad for a babysitters' co-op, which appeared to be run by a woman and six of her female family members. He filled out the form, clicked send and crossed his fingers they'd get back to him soon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ten minutes later his phone rang. "Hello?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Mr. Hale?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Speakin'. Who's this?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Marianne Smolen. You sent an online inquiry to Helping Hands Daycare Co-op?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Wow. That's what I call a fast response."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"This is the only time of day I can deal with business. So before I get to your questions . . . can you give me some more family information?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A ball of dread tightened in his gut. "Sure. What would you like to know?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You indicated that your daughter Olivia is five and you've been a single parent since she was six months old?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes. Her mother died when she was a baby." Please don't ask specifics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sorry. As a single parent myself, I know how hard that is. Do you have other family members helping you out with her care?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Olivia spent one day a week with my sister-in-law until she had a baby two months ago. Olivia spends some weekends with her maternal grandparents. The rest of my workin' hours she's either with me or I have someone come in to take care of her."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"She's not new to a daycare situation."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No. We tried the drop-off type a couple of times and it never worked out. In-home daycare is better for both of us."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"For this summer session you're only looking for part-time care?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yeah. Olivia will be attending two different camps, so I'll only need daycare three other days during the week."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Living in Muddy Gap is a bit of a drive for us, since we're based in Rawlins."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm willin' to pay for travel time. But they'll need to be here by seven thirty a.m."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Would you need a childcare provider with her own vehicle?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Weird question. "Only to drive here. I'm not lookin' for someone to haul Olivia around, just someone to take care of her in her own home when I'm at work."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Understood. To be clear, the reason we're called a co-op is I have six daycare workers in my employ. Because you'd be a part-time client, I can't guarantee a specific caregiver, but I believe that might serve your needs better given the other information you provided about Olivia."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You have any questions for me?" she prompted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What are the ages of the caregivers you're considering for this position?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"All teenagers, all out of high school and attending college, all with great referrals, which can be shared upon request." She paused. "I'll be blunt, Mr. Hale. This isn't the most economical option for any family. Are you sure you want to proceed?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Streeter's cheeks flushed. He hated the assumption that he was dirt poor just because he was a ranch hand and lived in a trailer. "Yep. Do I need to pay a deposit?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We call it an application fee, which you can pay online." Papers shuffled in the background. "I'd like to send a caregiver one day this week. Wednesday at noon?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That'll work. Have her call my cell when she arrives at the Split Rock Resort and I'll meet her and show her where to go."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Perfect. I'll email you an invoice with the pay link. And if anything changes, please contact us. We have a twenty-four-hour answering service."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Will do."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She hung up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Streeter stared at the phone for a moment. Then he said, "Huh. I guess when one door closes-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I always close the door, Daddy," Olivia interjected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He glanced over at his daughter sprawled on the couch, wondering how much of his conversation she'd paid attention to. "Most of the time you do."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Did I get a new babysitter?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So she had been listening. "Yep. Someone will be here this week."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Is she old like Mrs. McC?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Nope."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She rolled on to her stomach and looked at him. "I heard you tell 'em I don't got a mommy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's something they need to know, squirt."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Olivia crossed, uncrossed and recrossed her ankles as she studied him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He braced himself. Any change in her life triggered questions about her mother. He just hoped it didn't trigger her night terrors too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Can I ask you something, Daddy?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"If I had my mommy would I still have a babysitter?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How was he supposed to answer that? "Maybe."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She considered his response for a moment. "Gramma Deenie always tells me that my mommy loved me so so so much." Cross, uncross, recross. "But I think she's lyin'."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus. "Why would you think that, Olivia?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Because Gramma cries every time she says it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Talkin' about your mom always makes your gramma sad."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Maybe Gramma was sad because she knew my mommy didn't love me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He took a deep breath in and let it out softly. The therapist told him to let these types of conversations run their course. Don't correct her. Don't change the subject. Ask her questions and listen to her answers. "You still haven't given me a reason why you think your mother didn't love you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Because if she really loved me then she wouldna died."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Streeter moved to sit beside her. He smoothed back her staticky hair. "Darlin' girl, we've talked about this. All the love in the world can't keep anyone from dyin'. My mama loved me and she died too."</p><p>&nbsp;&lt;...</p></p><h2>God, Dreams, and Revelation: A Christian Interpretation of Dreams (Revised and Expanded Edition)</h2><p>In this revised and expanded edition, Morton Kelsey--well known for his writings that connect religion and psychology--summarizes new findings in dream research and puts the meaning of dreams into perspective.

It has been a source of inspiration to artists, astronomers, poets, and mathematicians alike. But how much do we really know about our closest neighbor? Explore the history of mankind&#39;s relationship with the Moon: the science, the myths, the facts, the fiction, and how it affects our everyday lives and the world around us.</p><p>Gr 7 Up-Pang gives an exhaustive overview of everything in relation to Earth&#39;s moon. Each section dedicated to one topic, starting with basic facts, followed by debunking myths, then to space exploration, and finally current studies about the moon and its ability to hold life. The beautiful illustrations, a highlight of the book, allow the text to truly come alive and provide visual aid to the science behind the moon&#39;s orbit, its relation to Earth, and the other components of the solar system. The diagrams and explanations of tides, orbit, and more could be very useful for science lessons. However, the text is very small and hard to decipher at times, causing an issue with readability. In some sections, the flow of the chapter is thrown off. For example, in the first chapter the reader is introduced to the origin of the moon with diagrams and historical beginnings, and then a Tlingit legend about the moon is included before moving on to how tides work. The other chapters have better flow and do a better job of sticking to the overall theme, but there is still an issue of confusing organization. There is a glossary of terms and glossary of people to know, but it lacks a bibliography, references, or an index.

This provocative, and often overlooked letter is the founding document of liberation theology&#x2014;the theology that seeks to preserve Jesus' "preferential option for the poor."

King Lamech expands his rule through deception and force, but does his kindness toward Noah hint that things may change? <br> Noah and Emzara explore their world and their eyes are opened anew to the creative genius of the Most High, yet mankind&#x2019;s wretchedness threatens to upend their peaceful corner of the world. While tracking down the perpetrator of a malicious crime, they are tested by tragedy and must decide if they will sacrifice everything for truth and justice. <br> After years of serving God, Noah reaches a crisis of faith due to his mounting frustrations with the proliferation of sin and the apparent silence from the Creator. Thrust into a series of perilous situations, Noah&#x2019;s deepest convictions are challenged. His response will direct his course and change the world forever. <p> More than just a novel, <i>Noah: Man of Resolve</i> features non-fiction sections in the back of the book that provide answers to popular questions about the time in which Noah lived and explain where certain characters and events from the book can be seen at the Ark Encounter in Williamstown, Kentucky.</p></p><p><p>Tim Chaffey is a writer and editor with Answers in Genesis.

Set in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, <em>The Only Thing Worth Dying For</em> chronicles the untold story of the team of Green Berets led by Captain Jason Amerine that conquered the Taliban and helped bring Hamid Karzai to power in Afghanistan. In the tradition of <em>Black Hawk Down</em>, <em>The Only Thing Worth Dying For</em> is, in the words of former Congressman Charlie Wilson (from <em>Charlie Wilson's War</em>), "the one book you must read if you have any hope of understanding what our fine American soldiers are up against in Afghanistan."</p></p><p><p>On a moonless night just weeks after September 11, 2001, U.S. Special Forces team ODA 574 infiltrates the mountains of southern Afghanistan with a seemingly impossible mission: to foment a tribal revolt and force the Taliban to surrender. Armed solely with the equipment they can carry on their backs, shockingly scant intelligence, and their mastery of guerrilla warfare, Captain Jason Amerine and his men have no choice but to trust their only ally, a little-known Pashtun statesman named Hamid Karzai who has returned from exile and is being hunted by the Taliban as he travels the countryside raising a militia.</p><p><em>The Only Thing Worth Dying For</em> chronicles the most important mission in the early days of the Global War on Terror, when the men on the ground knew little about the enemy&#x2014;and their commanders in Washington knew even less. With unprecedented access to surviving members of ODA 574, key war planners, and Karzai himself, award-winning author Eric Blehm cuts through the noise of politicians and high-level military officials to narrate for the first time a story of uncommon bravery and terrible sacrifice, intimately exposing the realities of unconventional warfare and nation-building in Afghanistan that continue to shape the region today.</p><p>Eric Blehm is the award-winning author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Fearless</em> and <em>The Only Thing Worth Dying For</em>. His first book, <em>The Last Season</em>, was the winner of the National Outdoor Book Award and was named by <em>Outside</em> magazine as one of the "greatest adventure biographies ever written."

This document is a thorough description of how the CIA recommends interrogating a subject. To get the information that is needed there is nothing withheld short of torture. For example in &#34;Threats and Fears,&#34; the CIA authors note that &#34;the threat of coercion usually weakens or destroys resistance more effectively than coercion itself. The threat to inflict pain, for example, can trigger fears more damaging than the immediate sensation of pain.&#34; Under the subheading &#34;Pain,&#34; the guidelines discuss the theories behind various thresholds of pain, and recommend that a subject&#39;s &#34;resistance is likelier to be sapped by pain which he seems to inflict upon himself&#34; such rather than by direct torture. The report suggests forcing the detainee to stand at attention for long periods of time. A section on sensory deprivations suggests imprisoning detainees in rooms without sensory stimuli of any kind, &#34;in a cell which has no light,&#34; for example.</p><p></p><h2>Fame (PENGUIN MODERN)</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Andy Warhol (1928-1987) was a painter, graphic artist filmmaker, and leader of the Pop Art movement.

Knitters are treated to hats, mittens, and gloves featuring Cascade's brand-new "Sportweight" yarn, a lighter variety with a crisp finish and great stitch definition. Projects include a snowflake scarf, a checkerboard muffler, Fairisle Beret, Herringbone Mitts, and a Zigzag Lace Stole.</p><p>Twenty scarves, 20 hats, and 20 mittens are on display here. Page one leads off with a lace slouchy hat, and 59 projects later, we finish off with long-sleeve mittens (gauntlets) that feature bobbles and cables. Although the title calls the projects &#x201c;quick,&#x201d; they are not particularly easy. A variety of stitches, including Fair Isle, are used throughout. The directions are delivered concisely, and charts are prevalent. The finished projects offer something for almost everyone&#x2014;on the distaff side, at least, though some of the caps can be adapted for men. Children get some cute caps, especially one that looks like a puppy. One of the best elements of the book is the up-close color photos. Knitters will really get to see what their finished projects will (hopefully) look like. Though all this winter gear is knit in Cascade sport yarn, any yarn of the same weight should do. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Passing Strange</h2><p><p><b>Inspired by the pulps, film noir, and screwball comedy, <i>Passing Strange</i> is a story as unusual and complex as San Francisco itself from World Fantasy Award winning author Ellen Klages, and a finalist for the 2017 Nebula Award for Best Novella</b><br><b></b><br>San Francisco in 1940 is a haven for the unconventional.

The world that these characters inhabit vibrates with bright colors, friendly animals, and buildings and woods of the timeless fairy-tale variety. Scary things happen, but only to the bad guys, and only offstage. Jack's giant dies falling from the beanstalk and Gretel pushes the witch into the oven, but the Big Bad Wolf escapes the woodcutter with only a scolding after he lets Red Riding Hood and her grandmother out of his stomach unharmed. Even the Gingerbread Boy eludes the fox and keeps on running at the end of the story. The artist portrays two of the three little pigs as female, as are the posh city mouse and her homely country cousin. The humorous expressions of the characters (see Goldilocks sinking into Mama Bear's super-soft bed for a laugh) and the lines of text incorporated into the illustrations are classic Engelbreit touches. This cheery collection will appeal to the artist's fans, as well as to anyone looking for not-too-scary versions of old favorites for young children.&#x2014;<i>Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Carroll County Public Library, MD</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His eyes became wild and his face flushed to match his red beard and hair. That she hadn't forgotten. But she had minimized how angry he would be when she'd decided to come here tonight. There was no choice. She was running out of time.<br><br>She proceeded with a pained, set smile until she stood before him.<br><br>"Nicole," he ground out between his teeth, "what in the hell are you doing here?"<br><br>Her gaze flickered over the whore's rouged nipples, boldly cresting her bodice. Rolling her eyes, Nicole retorted, "Just what in the hell are <i>you</i> doing here?"<br><br>With some muffled words and a pat on the woman's arm, her father shooed the prostitute away, then sharply motioned for Nicole to sit. "I came here looking for information," he answered brusquely.<br><br>"Ohhh," she said as she gave him a frown of disbelief. "Is that what they're calling it now?"<br><br>"That's <i>clever,</i>" he replied with thick sarcasm, absently raising his mug. Nicole wrinkled her nose at the dented and grimy container. He looked in it, frowned, then placed it well away from him. "I'd planned to meet a man here who knows about the sabotage. It happens that he's connected with that woman." With a slightly wounded look, he added, "You know me better than that."<br><br>Nicole nodded grudgingly and gave him a small, apologetic smile. It lasted only seconds before she became serious at the mention of sabotage. Sailing in these times was perilous enough, with captains setting speed records and shipbuilders fearlessly pushing new designs. Masts rigged to snap and rudders set to be lost in the first heavy storm made it deadly.<br><br>"Tell me you have some idea who's doing this," she said. Her father's shipping line hadn't been targeted -- yet -- but he'd decided to take the offensive.<br><br>"I'm finally getting some good leads," he said in a manner that closed the subject. "Now, what in God's name are you doing here?"<br><br>"Well. I've been thinking..." But as she started the speech she'd rehearsed during her trip from Paris, with all her reasons why she should sail with him in the upcoming Great Circle Race from London to Sydney, the doxy appeared again, sidling up to her father. Giving Nicole a nasty look, she began a provocative whispering in his ear.<br><br>Her father wasn't sending the woman packing anytime soon, and Nicole wasn't about to watch their murmured conversation. Turning from them, she dropped her chin onto the back of her chair and settled in to watch all the British tars and explicitly dressed women while they "mingled."<br><br>The earthy scenes had her wide-eyed. She imagined these sights would only add fodder to her late-night dreams, dreams in which a dark, faceless man...did things to her. Things that she'd seen between couples on the quay. She sighed. What would she dream tonight...?<br><br>A loud thud shook her from her musings, and her gaze turned to the front door as three men marched in out of the cold.<br><br>They wore expensive and tastefully cut clothes, marking them as gentlemen. <i>Drunken gentlemen,</i> she amended as she got a better look at them. These were jaded high-steppers out for a night of cheap drink and even cheaper debauchery. Well, they'd come to the right place.<br><br>Although the men didn't attract nearly the interest that she had on her own entrance, the tavern quieted upon their arrival. Probably because the largest man was massive -- over six feet and obviously well built in his tailored clothing.<br><br>But that wasn't what drew her awareness. No, it was the air of menace, seething and palpable, that reverberated in him. Even when he sat down with his long legs stretched out in front of his chair, his guise relaxed, she sensed a latent tension in him. The others sensed it, too. The parties of seamen, the crimps, the colorful doxies acted like skittish animals when forced to walk past his table.<br><br>He was the only one of the three men not noticeably inebriated, and strangely enough, when his eyes flicked over the room, a look like disgust lit his face. Why would he come to a place that offended him?<br><br>Then, as if her curiosity had drawn his attention, the man turned his intense gaze on her. After a second, his eyes narrowed. She sucked in a breath and knew: He saw through her disguise! Looked past the boys' clothes and somehow made her feel bare before him.<br><br>When the look in his eyes changed to show blatant appreciation, all rational thought evaporated like fog baked away under a southern sun. Her dark imaginings sputtered and lurched to life once more.<br><br>He looked at her as though she were the only woman in the room, a room thick with willing, half-naked women. What if she were one of them, and he called for her? What would it be like to straddle him, to envelop him in pied skirts as he absently drank, pinching and petting her bare skin beneath?<br><br>That feeling from her dreams returned -- the unnamed response that felt like fear, surprise, and hunger battling inside her belly. <i>He</i> caused it now. It strengthened as his heated gaze ran over her.<br><br>"I see you've noticed Captain Sutherland," her father cut in dryly.<br><br>Nicole jerked her eyes away, her face heating furiously. But then the name sank into her muddled mind: Sutherland, the dissolute captain of the <i>Southern Cross,</i> the owner of the now failing Peregrine Shipping line -- and her father's most bitter enemy.<br><br>"That's <i>Derek Sutherland?</i>" she asked in hushed amazement, staring at her father in wonder. The idea that he continually crossed this lethal-looking man was cause to make her alternately cheer his bravery and question his sanity.<br><br>"The one and only," he said as he stood. Bidding his doxy good night, he motioned impatiently for Nicole to follow him. "Looks as though we'll be leaving." Her father's face turned fierce. "Because if he keeps staring at you like that, I'll have to make good on my threats and kill the bastard."<br><br>As she followed him through the crowd, some urge goaded her to glance back at Sutherland. She gave in to the temptation, only to find his eyes on her.<br><br><i>Watch</i> was too tame a word for what he did -- his gaze roamed over her in a proprietary manner that defied her to walk away from him.<br><br>But she would.<br><br>Such an intriguing-looking man, despite his deeply lined countenance. What a waste, she mused acidly as she turned away.<br><br>Seconds later, long, strong fingers encircled her wrist. She knew it was Sutherland even before she turned and their eyes locked. His flesh was hot on hers -- his hand was callused.<br><br>"Stay," he said simply.<br><br>From his manner, she got the impression he expected her to do just that. Did he think all he had to do was command her? The arrogance! So why did she find herself fighting a very real desire to remain?<br><br>"Take your hand off me, Captain."<br><br>When he didn't, she twisted her arm out of his grasp. In response, he gave her a mocking half-bow. How could he be so unconcerned? How could he seem bored when attraction fired hot and swift within her? Angered, she gave him a forbidding glare. "Nonchalance, Captain? How indifferent will you be when you lose the Great Circle Race by, say..." she tapped her cheek, "...a thousand miles?"<br><br>She could have sworn she saw the corners of his lips curl up before her father returned to yank her away.<br><br>"Damn it, Nicole, when will you learn?" he demanded before the toe of her boot had touched the refuse-strewn street. "Walking into the Mermaid as if you owned it! Hell, it's because of men like Sutherland that you shouldn't be in a place like that."<br><br>"I've been in worse," she countered as he anxiously led her away.<br><br>"But to attract <i>Sutherland'</i>s attention and then antagonize him?" He threw another look over his shoulder. "It's as if you're drawn to trouble."<br><br>"Well, trouble and I do go way back," she said between short breaths as she struggled to keep up with her father. He twisted around and frowned at her before slowing his progress down the quay. "If he's such a bad man, then for God's sake, why do you go out of your way to cross him?"<br><br>"I have my reasons for plaguing Sutherland. Good reasons. Besides, he's <i>British.</i>" The look Lassiter gave her said he'd explained what should be obvious to anyone with American blood in them.<br><br>"Mama was British," Nicole pointed out, even though they'd been through this again and again.<br><br>"She was the only one of this whole lot I ever respected." His eyes betrayed much more than simple respect for his late wife. Laurel Banning Lassiter had been a noblewoman of English birth, whose memory was never far from their minds. <br>His voice hardened again as he looked at her. "That man is a wastrel and a brute and you're to have nothing to do with him. He'd use you and throw you away without so much as a good-bye. Especially since he knows I'm connected to you in some way." He paused, then added starkly, "If he realizes you're my daughter, I can't imagine what the cold-blooded bastard will do."<br><br>They walked on in silence, Nicole quiet as she thought about Sutherland. She didn't think it likely he'd recognize her since she took after her mother and bore little resemblance to her father -- except perhaps a reddish tint to her hair. And, of course, in attitude.<br><br>"I don't think he'll even remember me in the morning," she finally assured him, though secretly, perversely, the idea displeased her. "After all, he'll most likely get drunk tonight."<br><br>Her father grunted. "Not so drunk that he'd forget you." He placed a hand on her shoulder, steering her around the ship debris speckling the docks. "But enough of that devil. Why aren't you in school?"<br><br>When she looked away, he asked in a voice laced with resignation, "You got thrown out again, didn't you?"<br><br>Nicole gave a delicate cough. "My leaving was mutually agreed upon." He scowled, striding on, and she added under her breath, "To the great glee of my headmistress."<br><br>When they approached the dockside that berthed her father's ship, the <i>Bella Nicola,</i> a rush of emotion brought the sting of tears to her eyes. A striking clipper with a sharp navy hull and jaunty white and red accents, it stood out among the hulks in the harbor as a diamond would amidst coal.<br><br><i>This is my home.</i> She'd longed to be back aboard and had missed the ship as though she were a friend. Her breath hitched, but she didn't want her father to notice her missish reaction. To mask it, she commented in an airy tone, "Really, Father, I don't understand why you're still fuming at me."<br><br>"Don't understand?" he asked. "How did you expect me to react when you've been dismissed from the finest finishing school on the Continent? Pleased?"<br><br>"It really wasn't a dismissal like the other schools," she replied, warming to the subject. "I choose to call it a 'conclusion.'"<br><br>"Well, if this is you after your <i>conclusion,</i>" -- he turned her to survey her hair-stuffed cap and boys' trousers -- "your grandmother should demand her money back."<br><br>"Pssh. When I first got there, they told me I had to master seven subjects out of nine, which -- I -- did." He'd never know it had taken everything in her power to do so. She found it difficult to acquire graces designed to snag a rich, titled husband. Because at twenty and with her quirky looks, she was not just firmly on the shelf. She was on the top shelf -- the one it took a ladder to get to.<br><br>"And I suppose it's only coincidence that you finished seven with enough time to travel back here just days before the Great Circle Race."<br><br>Nicole looked away again. She'd been planning to sail the race for the past two years, ever since reading about Queen Victoria's decree for a global contest open to sailors of any nationality. She'd decided then that nothing would stand in her way. Not slapped hands when she chose the wrong utensil nor ridiculing dance masters, and not the constant teasing about her being too old for school. Especially not a hard-as-iron headmistress bent on cramming her into a proper-lady mold and chopping off anything that remained outside.<br><br>This race would be the greatest in history -- a win could catapult their line to worldwide recognition -- and she wanted nothing more than to be a part of it.<br><br>When she didn't respond, he teasingly pulled her cap down, then asked in a conciliatory tone, "So tell me, what were the two subjects you failed?"<br><br>Popping her hat back up, she feigned a grave look. "Alas, I fear that floral arrangement and playing the harpsichord are forever out of my grasp. As you can imagine, the knowledge of my deficiencies is crushing," she added as she checked an imaginary tear.<br><br>Lassiter looked to chuckle in response, his stifled smile showing her that he was happy to see her. But he made his features stern again. "Listen to me, Nicole. I want to enjoy our time together before I sail, so let's get one thing straight about the race."<br><br>Her brows drew together. Dear Lord, he couldn't be; he was opening his mouth, his face set to tell her she...wouldn't be sailing. "Don't say anything yet -- please," she said in a rush of words. "Just give me a few days to prove to you that you need me in the race." And every voyage after.<br><br>"Nicole, it's not going to -- "<br><br>"<i>Please!</i>" She grabbed his forearm and began to speak, but he held up his rope-scarred hand to forestall her.<br><br>She decided then that she couldn't win this skirmish. But this was hardly over. She had other arrows in her quiver for their next round, so she reeled in her thoughts and forced herself to let the fight lie for now.<br><br>And was even silent when he said, "I'll make this as clear as possible: Nicole, there is no way in hell you are sailing this...</p><h2>Mary Ann in Autumn: A Tales of the City Novel</h2><p><p><strong>Inspiration for the Netflix Limited Series,&nbsp;<em>Tales of the City</em></strong></p><p><strong>The eighth novel in the beloved <em>Tales of the City</em> series, Armistead Maupin&#x2019;s best-selling San Francisco saga.</strong></p><p>Following the success of his <em>New York Times </em>bestseller <em>Michael Tolliver Lives</em>, Armistead Maupin&#x2019;s <em>Mary Ann in Autumn </em>is a touching portrait of friendship, family, and fresh starts, as the City by the Bay welcomes back Mary Ann Singleton, the beloved <em>Tales of the City</em> heroine who started it all.

She is also the author of the bestselling In Death series written under the pen name J. D. Robb. There are more than 500 million copies of her books in print.Two<i>Harper House</i>January 2004&nbsp;She couldn&#x2019;t afford to be intimidated by the house, or by its mistress. They both had reputations.The house was said to be elegant and old, with gardens that rivaled Eden. She&#x2019;d just confirmed that for herself.The woman was said to be interesting, somewhat solitary, and perhaps a bit &#x201c;difficult.&#x201d; A word, Stella knew, that could mean anything from strong-willed to stone bitch.Either way, she could handle it, she reminded herself as she fought the need to get up and pace. She&#x2019;d handled worse.She needed this job. Not just for the salary&#x2013;&#x2013;and it was generous&#x2013;&#x2013;but for the structure, for the challenge, for the doing. Doing more, she knew, than circling the wheel she&#x2019;d fallen into back home.She needed a life, something more than clocking time, drawing a paycheck that would be soaked up by bills. She needed, however self-help-book it sounded, something that fulfilled and challenged her.Rosalind Harper was fulfilled, Stella was sure. A beautiful ancestral home, a thriving business. What was it like, she wondered, to wake up every morning knowing exactly where you belonged and where you were going?If she could earn one thing for herself, and give that gift to her children, it would be the sense of knowing. She was afraid she&#x2019;d lost any clear sight of that with Kevin&#x2019;s death. The sense of doing, no problem. Give her a task or a challenge and the room to accomplish or solve it, she was your girl.But the sense of knowing who she was, in the heart of herself, had been mangled that day in September of 2001 and had never fully healed.This was her start, this move back to Tennessee. This final and face-to-face interview with Rosalind Harper. If she didn&#x2019;t get the job&#x2013;&#x2013;well, she&#x2019;d get another. No one could accuse her of not knowing how to work or how to provide a living for herself and her kids.But, God, she wanted <i>this</i> job.She straightened her shoulders and tried to ignore all the whispers of doubt muttering inside her head. She&#x2019;d get this one.She&#x2019;d dressed carefully for this meeting. Businesslike but not fussy, in a navy suit and starched white blouse. Good shoes, good bag, she thought. Simple jewelry. Nothing flashy. Subtle makeup, to bring out the blue of her eyes. She&#x2019;d fought her hair into a clip at the nape of her neck. If she was lucky, the curling mass of it wouldn&#x2019;t spring out until the interview was over.Rosalind was keeping her waiting. It was probably a mind game, Stella decided as her fingers twisted, untwisted her watchband. Letting her sit and stew in the gorgeous parlor, letting her take in the lovely antiques and paintings, the sumptuous view from the front windows.All in that dreamy and gracious southern style that reminded her she was a Yankee fish out of water.Things moved slower down here, she reminded herself. She would have to remember that this was a different pace from the one she was used to, and a different culture.The fireplace was probably an Adams, she decided. That lamp was certainly an original Tiffany. Would they call those drapes portieres down here, or was that too Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara? Were the lace panels under the drapes heirlooms?God, had she ever been more out of her element? What was a middle-class widow from Michigan doing in all this southern splendor?She steadied herself, fixed a neutral expression on her face, when she heard footsteps coming down the hall.&#x201c;Brought coffee.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t Rosalind, but the cheerful man who&#x2019;d answered the door and escorted Stella to the parlor.He was about thirty, she judged, average height, very slim. He wore his glossy brown hair waved around a movie-poster face set off by sparkling blue eyes. Though he wore black, Stella found nothing butlerlike about it. Much too artsy, too stylish. He&#x2019;d said his name was David.He set the tray with its china pot and cups, the little linen napkins, the sugar and cream, and the tiny vase with its clutch of violets on the coffee table.&#x201c;Roz got a bit hung up, but she&#x2019;ll be right along, so you just relax and enjoy your coffee. You comfortable in here?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, very.&#x201d;&#x201c;Anything else I can get you while you&#x2019;re waiting on her?&#x201d;&#x201c;No. Thanks.&#x201d;&#x201c;You just settle on in, then,&#x201d; he ordered, and poured coffee into a cup. &#x201c;Nothing like a fire in January, is there? Makes you forget that a few months ago it was hot enough to melt the skin off your bones. What do you take in your coffee, honey?&#x201d;She wasn&#x2019;t used to being called &#x201c;honey&#x201d; by strange men who served her coffee in magnificent parlors. Especially since she suspected he was a few years her junior.&#x201c;Just a little cream.&#x201d; She had to order herself not to stare at his face&#x2013;&#x2013;it was, well, delicious, with that full mouth, those sapphire eyes, the strong cheekbones, the sexy little dent in the chin. &#x201c;Have you worked for Ms. Harper long?&#x201d;&#x201c;Forever.&#x201d; He smiled charmingly and handed her the coffee. &#x201c;Or it seems like it, in the best of all possible ways. Give her a straight answer to a straight question, and don&#x2019;t take any bullshit.&#x201d; His grin widened. &#x201c;She <i>hates</i> it when people kowtow. You know, honey, I love your hair.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Automatically, she lifted a hand to it. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;&#x201c;Titian knew what he was doing when he painted that color. Good luck with Roz,&#x201d; he said as he started out. &#x201c;Great shoes, by the way.&#x201d;She sighed into her coffee. He&#x2019;d noticed her hair and her shoes, complimented her on both. Gay. Too bad for her side.It was good coffee, and David was right. It was nice having a fire in January. Outside, the air was moist and raw, with a broody sky overhead. A woman could get used to a winter hour by the fire drinking good coffee out of&#x2013;&#x2013;what was it? Meissen, Wedgwood? Curious, she held the cup up to read the maker&#x2019;s mark.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Staffordshire, brought over by one of the Harper brides from England in the mid-nineteenth century.&#x201d;No point in cursing herself, Stella thought. No point in cringing about the fact that her redhead&#x2019;s complexion would be flushed with embarrassment. She simply lowered the cup and looked Rosalind Harper straight in the eye.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always thought so.&#x201d; She came in, plopped down in the chair beside Stella&#x2019;s, and poured herself a cup.One of them, Stella realized, had miscalculated the dress code for the interview.Rosalind had dressed her tall, willowy form in a baggy olive sweater and mud-colored work pants that were frayed at the cuffs. She was shoeless, with a pair of thick brown socks covering long, narrow feet. Which accounted, Stella supposed, for her silent entry into the room.Her hair was short, straight, and black.Though to date all their communications had been via phone, fax, or e-mail, Stella had Googled her. She&#x2019;d wanted background on her potential employer&#x2013;&#x2013;and a look at the woman.Newspaper and magazine clippings had been plentiful. She&#x2019;d studied Rosalind as a child, through her youth. She&#x2019;d marveled over the file photos of the stunning and delicate bride of eighteen and sympathized with the pale, stoic-looking widow of twenty-five.There had been more, of course. Society-page stuff, gossipy speculation on when and if the widow would marry again. Then quite a bit of press surrounding the forging of the nursery business, her gardens, her love life. Her brief second marriage and divorce.Stella&#x2019;s image had been of a strong-minded, shrewd woman. But she&#x2019;d attributed those stunning looks to camera angles, lighting, makeup.She&#x2019;d been wrong.At forty-six, Rosalind Harper was a rose in full bloom. Not the hothouse sort, Stella mused, but one that weathered the elements, season after season, and came back, year after year, stronger and more beautiful.She had a narrow face angled with strong bones and deep, long eyes the color of single-malt scotch. Her mouth, full, strongly sculpted lips, was unpainted&#x2013;&#x2013;as, to Stella&#x2019;s expert eye, was the rest of that lovely face.There were lines, those thin grooves that the god of time reveled in stamping, fanning out from the corners of the dark eyes, but they didn&#x2019;t detract.All Stella could think was, Could I be you, please, when I grow up? Only I&#x2019;d like to dress better, if you don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201c;Kept you waiting, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;Straight answers, Stella reminded herself. &#x201c;A little, but it&#x2019;s not much of a hardship to sit in this room and drink good coffee out of Staffordshire.&#x201d;&#x201c;David likes to fuss. I was in the propagation house, got caught up.&#x201d;Her voice, Stella thought, was brisk. Not clipped&#x2013;&#x2013;you just couldn&#x2019;t clip Tennessee&#x2013;&#x2013;but it was to the point and full of energy. &#x201c;You look younger than I expected. You&#x2019;re what, thirty-three?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#x201c;And your sons are . . . six and eight?&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t bring them with you?&#x201d;&#x201c;No. They&#x2019;re with my father and his wife right now.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very fond of Will and Jolene. How are they?&#x201d;&#x201c;They&#x2019;re good. They&#x2019;re enjoying having their grandchildren around.&#x201d;&#x201c;I imagine so. Your daddy shows off pictures of them from time to time and just about bursts with pride.&#x201d;&#x201c;One of my reasons for relocating here is so they can have more time together.&#x201d;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good reason. I like young boys myself. Miss having them around. The fact that you come with two played in your favor. Your r�sum�, your father&#x2019;s recommendation, the letter from your former employer&#x2013;&#x2013;well, none of that hurt.&#x201d;She picked up a cookie from the tray, bit in, without her eyes ever leaving Stella&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;I need an organizer, someone creative and hardworking, personable and basically tireless. I like people who work for me to keep up with me, and I set a strong pace.&#x201d;&#x201c;So I&#x2019;ve been told.&#x201d; Okay, Stella thought, brisk and to the point in return. &#x201c;I have a degree in nursery management. With the exception of three years when I stayed home to have my children&#x2013;&#x2013;and during which time I landscaped my own yard and two neighbors&#x2019;&#x2013;&#x2013;I&#x2019;ve worked in that capacity. For more than two years now, since my husband&#x2019;s death, I&#x2019;ve raised my sons and worked outside the home in my field. I&#x2019;ve done a good job with both. I can keep up with you, Ms. Harper. I can keep up with anyone.&#x201d;Maybe, Roz thought. Just maybe. &#x201c;Let me see your hands.&#x201d;A little irked, Stella held them out. Roz set down her coffee, took them in hers. She turned them palms up, ran her thumbs over them. &#x201c;You know how to work.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, I do.&#x201d;&#x201c;Banker suit threw me off. Not that it isn&#x2019;t a lovely suit.&#x201d; Roz smiled, then polished off the cookie. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been damp the last couple of days. Let&#x2019;s see if we can put you in some boots so you don&#x2019;t ruin those very pretty shoes. I&#x2019;ll show you around.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boots were too big, and the army-green rubber hardly flattering, but the damp ground and crushed gravel would have been cruel to her new shoes.Her own appearance hardly mattered when compared with the operation Rosalind Harper had built.In the Garden spread over the west side of the estate. The garden center faced the road, and the grounds at its entrance and running along the sides of its parking area were beautifully landscaped. Even in January, Stella could see the care and creativity put into the presentation with the selection and placement of evergreens and ornamental trees, the mulched rises where she assumed there would be color from bulbs and perennials, from splashy annuals through the spring and summer and into fall.After one look she didn&#x2019;t want the job. She was desperate for it. The lust tied knots of nerves and desire in her belly, the kinds that were usually reserved for a lover.&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want the retail end of this near the house,&#x201d; Roz said as she parked the truck. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to see commerce out my parlor window. Harpers are, and always have been, business-minded. Even back when some of the land around here was planted with cotton instead of houses.&#x201d;Because Stella&#x2019;s mouth was too dry to speak, she only nodded. The main house wasn&#x2019;t visible from here. A wedge of natural woods shielded it from view and kept the long, low outbuildings, the center itself, and, she imagined, most of the greenhouses from intruding on any view from Harper House.And just look at that gorgeous old ruby horse chestnut!&#x201c;This section&#x2019;s open to the public twelve months a year,&#x201d; Roz continued. &#x201c;We carry all the sidelines you&#x2019;d expect, along with houseplants and a selection of gardening books. My oldest son&#x2019;s helping me manage this section, though he&#x2019;s happier in the greenhouses or out in the field. We&#x2019;ve got two part-time clerks right now. We&#x2019;ll need more in a few weeks.&#x201d;Get your head in the game, Stella ordered herself. &#x201c;Your busy season would start in March in this zone.&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; Roz led the way to the low-slung white building, up an asphalt ramp, across a spotlessly clean porch, and inside.Two long, wide counters on either side of the door, Stella noted. Plenty of light to keep it cheerful. There were shelves stocked with soil additives, plant foods, pesticides, spin racks of seeds. More shelves held books or colorful pots suitable for herbs or windowsill plants. There were displays of wind chimes, garden plaques, and other accessories.A woman with snowy white hair dusted a display of sun catchers. She wore a pale blue cardigan with roses embroidered down the front over a white shirt that looked to have been starched stiff as iron.&#x201c;Ruby, this is Stella Rothchild. I&#x2019;m showing her around.&#x201d;&#x201c;Pleased to meet you.&#x201d;The calculating look told Stella the woman knew she was in about the job opening, but the smile was perfectly cordial. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Will Dooley&#x2019;s daughter, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;&#x201c;From . . . up north.&#x201d;She said it, to Stella&#x2019;s amusement, as if it were a Third World country of dubious repute. &#x201c;From Michigan, yes. But I was born in Memphis.&#x201d;&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; The smile warmed, fractionally. &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s something, isn&#x2019;t it? Moved away when you were a little girl, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, with my mother.&#x201d;&#x201c;Thinking about moving back now, are you?&#x201d;&#x201c;I have moved back,&#x201d; Stella corrected.&#x201c;Well.&#x201d; The one word said they&#x2019;d see what they&#x2019;d see. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a raw one out there today,&#x201d; Ruby continued. &#x201c;Good day to be inside. You just look around all you want.&#x201d;&#x201c;Thanks. There&#x2019;s hardly anywhere I&#x2019;d rather be than inside a nursery.&#x201d;&#x201c;You picked a winner here. Roz, Marilee Booker was in and bought the dendrobium. I just couldn&#x2019;t talk her out of it.&#x201d;&#x201c;Well, shit. It&#x2019;ll be dead in a week.&#x201d;&#x201c;Dendrobiums are fairly easy care,&#x201d; Stella pointed out.&#x201c;Not for Marilee. She doesn&#x2019;t have a black thumb. Her whole arm&#x2019;s black to the elbow. That woman should be barred by law from having anything living within ten feet of her.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Roz. But I did make her promise to bring it back if it starts to look sickly.&#x201d;&#x201c;Not your fault.&#x201d; Roz waved it away, then moved through a wide opening. Here were the houseplants, from the exotic to the classic, and pots from thimble size to those with a girth as wide as a manhole cover. There were more accessories, too, like stepping-stones, trellises, arbor kits, garden fountains, and benches.&#x201c;I expect my staff to know a little bit about everything,&#x201d; Roz said as they walked through. &#x201c;And if they don&#x2019;t know the answer, they need to know how to find it. We&#x2019;re not big, not compared to some of the wholesale nurseries or the landscaping outfits. We&#x2019;re not priced like the garden centers at the discount stores. So we concentrate on offering the unusual plants along with the basic, and customer service. We make house calls.&#x201d;&#x201c;Do you have someone specific on staff who&#x2019;ll go do an on-site consult?&#x201d;&#x201c;Either Harper or I might go if you&#x2019;re talking about a customer who&#x2019;s having trouble with something bought here. Or if they just want some casual, personal advice.&#x201d;She slid her hands into her pockets, rocked back and fo...</p><h2>The Attorney (A Paul Madriani Novel)</h2><p><b>Paul Madriani takes on dual roles&#x2014;defense attorney and sleuth&#x2014;in this riveting legal thriller by the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Blood Flag</i> and <i>The Secret Partner</i>.</b><br><br>&#x201c;Legal thrillers don't get much better than this,&#x201d;&nbsp;wrote <i>Publishers Weekly</i> in praise of <i>The Judge</i>.&nbsp;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> hailed <i>Undue Influence</i> as &#x201c;the courtroom novel of the year.&#x201d; Now Martini delivers one of Paul Madriani&#x2019;s most challenging cases in <i>The Attorney</i>: where a drug-addicted mother is pitted against her daughter&#x2019;s newly rich grandfather in a contentious custody case that leads to criminal accusations&#x2014;and ultimately murder...</p><p>Sleuthing California defense counsel Paul Madriani lands one of his twistiest cases to date. His client, sport fisherman Jonah Hale, won $87 million in a lottery but lost his heart. Jonah's got custody of his eight-year-old grandkid Mandy, because his daughter Jessica is a cokehead party animal. Sprung from jail, Jessica demands cash. Jonah says no. So Jessica and Mandy disappear, with help from marital-rape-victim-turned-fanatical-activist Zolanda Suade. Suade's group, Vanishing Victims, specializes in thwarting courts and bashing rich males. <p> Madriani tries to reason with Suade, who almost pulls a gun on him, then taunts him with a press release: Suade's going public with Jessica's charge that Jonah molested Mandy. Madriani's girlfriend works in Child Protective Services, so he gets a tidbit or two of inside info--the charge is phony, but because CPS can't comment on cases, the smear will suffice to ignite a media firestorm. When Suade turns up dead, media interest does not subside. In court, circumstantial evidence forms a tightening noose around Jonah's neck, and Madriani starts wondering whether Jonah did kill Suade. Also, underworld types who may know Jessica and/or a Mexican drug lord start stalking Madriani, and more corpses pop up. </p><p> Martini, who covered the Manson trial, then became a lawyer and a bestselling novelist, is great at realistic, ingenious courtroom suspense, media-circus scenes, and dramatizing the impact of office politics on legal proceedings. His characters and prose are workmanlike but sturdy. Always grouped with lawyers-turned-writers Scott Turow and John Grisham, Martini thinks Turow's a better writer (in terms of character and dialogue), and Grisham's a natural-born storyteller who towers over all, but that he, Martini, is a better storyteller than Turow and a better writer than Grisham. <i>The Attorney</i> is evidence that he may be right. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>Steve Martini</b> worked as a newspaper reporter in Los Angeles and as a capital correspondent at the state house in Sacramento, California.

An influential artist and thinker, she was the author of several novels, short stories, critical studies, a collection of essays, two volumes of erotica, and nine published volumes of her Diary.Less shocking than <i>Incest</i> (1992), the third volume of Nin's provocative and provoking uncensored diaries finds our madly scribbling femme fatale in New York, where she's gone to get away from her doggedly loyal husband and from adored lover Henry Miller and indulge her fancy for analyst Otto Rank. Once again, Nin is blithely honest about her profound dishonesty, admitting that she loves telling "marvelous lies" to the men who desire her. She tires of Rank just as Miller and her husband catch up with her, then, suddenly, enters a whole new realm of potent romance with a fiery man of Inca descent, Gonzalo More. More, a man of conscience and lyrical intensity, inspires Nin to new poetic and mystical heights. These unexpurgated volumes are of particular interest to readers of the original published versions because they fill in so many puzzling omissions, but they are also remarkable for their audacity and prolificity. Just one page of Nin's extraordinary diaries contains more sex, melodrama, fantasies, confessions, and observations than most novels, and reflects much about the human psyche we strive to repress. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Sleight of Hand: A Novel of Suspense (Dana Cutler Series, 4)</h2><p><p>Private investigator Dana Cutler must take down a cunning psychopath before he can pull off the perfect crime, in <em>Sleight of Hand</em>, a novel of suspense from Phillip Margolin, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Capitol Murder</em> and <em>Supreme Justice.</em><br><br>Charles Benedict &#x2013; charismatic criminal defense lawyer, amateur illusionist, and professional hit man &#x2013; has performed his greatest sleight of hand yet: framing a millionaire for the murder of his much younger wife.<br><br>When Horace Blair married Carrie, the prosecutor in his DUI trial, he made her sign a prenuptial agreement guaranteeing her twenty million dollars if she remained faithful for the first ten years of marriage.

On stage, a good vaudeville routine could last years as it was performed on tour across the country. On radio, a year's vaudeville material might be fodder for one week's broadcast. Bob Hope used new material not only for his weekly radio series, but also for the several live charity appearances he made each week.<br><br>Organized by the stages of his life, accompanied by black-and-white photographs, this book gives readers a chance to enjoy the very best of Hope's jokes, from his early years in vaudeville, his top-rated radio show in the '30s and '40s, his legendary television appearances, and much more.</p><p><strong>Bob Hope</strong> was in the forefront of the entertainment industry for virtually his entire life. Primarily a comedian, he also acted, sang, and even danced, hosted his own radio and television shows, and starred in sixty movies. Bob Hope's dedication to and love for the American GI is legendary. He traveled around the world to entertain the men and women in uniform during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and Desert Storm. No individual in the history of show business journeyed so far--and so often--to entertain so many. He received more than two thousand awards and citations for his humanitarian and professional efforts, and was honored and befriended by every U.S. president since Franklin Roosevelt.<br><br> <strong>Linda Hope</strong>, Bob and Dolores Hope's daughter, is chief operating officer of Hope Enterprises, Inc., and producer of her father's television specials for the last twenty-five years. She lives in North Hollywood, California, and Ireland.Linda Hope, who assembled this volume, clearly understands her father, Bob, and that his life can best be told through his jokes. To read them is to know how he felt on personal and political issues, and their topical, satiric nature makes them more biographically relevant than old material from most other comedians. Linda opens the book with a brief summary of her dad's life (he will turn 100 next month). Ten sections follow chronologically, from Hope's childhood to the present. Cracking about his birth, "when the doctor slapped me, I thought it was applause," the comedian sets the stage for a self-portrait of a man who adored performing and making people laugh above all else. In his 20s, he spoofed early show business bookings, after which he describes meeting singer and future wife Dolores Reade as "love at first song." From this point, the legend grows increasingly familiar, with references to the Road pictures and Hope's first appearance, in 1939, hosting the Academy Awards. Considering the current political climate, his recurring tours entertaining troops through WWII and the Korean War are of particular interest ("I was offering time and laughs-the men and women fighting the war were offering up their lives"). Another line is a humorously accurate testament to Hope's longevity ("I've been with NBC so long. I was here when the peacock was just an egg"). The quality of the jokes range from gently amusing to side-splitting, mildly sharp but never mean-spirited. After reading them, it's easy to understand Hope saying he'd like to live his life all over again because "it's been a hell of a ride."

Based on the Cyrus Tang Hall of China exhibit at The Field Museum, China: A History traces the 7,000-year story of this diverse land. Full-color maps, photos, and illustrations of the people, landscape, artifacts, and rare objects bring the history of this nation to life! Young readers learn about prehistoric China, follow the reign of emperors and dynasties, and come to understand how China became the world power that it is today. The book also explores the role of children and women in everyday life as well as how religion, politics, and economics shaped the deep traditions and dynamic changes of modern China. This book stands alone from the exhibition and is a go-to resource for young readers looking to learn more about this powerful nation. It includes a timeline, bibliography, and index.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Cheryl Bardoe</b> is a former senior project manager of exhibitions at The Field Museum in Chicago. She is the author of <i>Gregor Mendel</i> and <i>Mammoths</i><i> and</i><i> Mastodons</i> and lives in Wallingford, Connecticut.<br> &nbsp;Gr 4-8-As rich as the history it relates, this book is thoroughly illustrated with artwork, maps, and photographs-most from the Field Museum Collection. As in Bardoe's other works, the writing is lucid and thoughtful, though the pace is very rapid; hundreds of years can pass in a paragraph. From the start, Bardoe stresses that there are "many Chinas." Five chapters cover prehistory (while introducing archaeological practices), early dynastic China, philosophies (Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, folk religion), interaction with other countries (14th to the 20th centuries), and China's future. Among the most attractive features in the book are the regular invitations for readers to imagine themselves living a specific cultural moment or role: in a Neolithic village, as a scholar-official, a nun, or a resident of Guangzhou during the Opium Wars. Politics (before the 1900s) and economics, agriculture and technology, are all given weight. Along the way, Bardoe describes the many contributions of China to culture and civilization, including several pages on opera, as well as acknowledging roles for, and restrictions on, the non-noble classes and women.

He maintains a cardiology practice in Miami Beach, where he lives with his wife.COOKING THE GLUTEN SOLUTION WAY<br><br>Welcome to the world of healthy and delicious gluten-free cooking, South Beach Diet style. We've applied the same proven principles that have helped millions of South Beach dieters lose weight and achieve better health to a flavor-packed cookbook for those concerned about gluten. Yes, you will lose weight if you enjoy our gluten-free recipes as part of an overall healthy eating plan. And by eating gluten free for a few weeks, you're likely to see common symptoms of gluten sensitivity such as bloating, abdominal pain, headaches, stiff joints, fatigue, sinus problems, brain fog, depression, and skin rashes disappear too.<br><br>Many people are under the misconception that gluten free is synonymous with inferior taste. That certainly does not have to be the case, as the recipes in this book will prove. What is true, though, is that unless carefully planned, a gluten-free diet can be nutritionally inferior to one that contains wheat, barley, and rye, particularly if a person relies on gluten- free packaged products as staples. While gluten-free foods may not contain the troublesome protein, they're often packed with saturated fat, sugar, and sodium. Many also include high-glycemic refined ingredients like white rice flour and potato starch that can cause swings in your blood sugar and trigger cravings.<br><br>These are concerns you won't have to worry about when you cook from this book. Each recipe was developed with good nutrition and flavor in mind. In fact, these dishes do more for your health than subtract gluten from your diet. They protect against heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. And they have been designed to help you lose weight if you want to&#x2014;something that not every gluten-free diet program or cookbook can deliver. In other words, they are good for your overall health, even if gluten doesn't turn out to be a problem for you. And they're also recipes you'll want to make time and again for your family and friends (who may or may not be gluten sensitive) because they're easy to make and they taste so good.<br><br>ABOUT THE SOUTH BEACH DIET GLUTEN SOLUTION PROGRAM<br><br>You certainly don't have to be gluten free to enjoy the recipes in this book, but having an overview of the South Beach Diet Gluten Solution Program's basic tenets may help you better understand how gluten could be affecting your life.<br><br>As with the original South Beach Diet, the Gluten Solution Program has three phases, which are designed to help you lose weight and ultimately achieve better health. Which phase you start on depends on how much weight you have to lose and whether you have cravings for sugary and starchy carbohydrates. You'll learn whether you are gluten sensitive&#x2014;and to what degree&#x2014;by giving up gluten for 4 weeks, then gradually reintroducing foods containing gluten to see if they trigger symptoms.<br><br>Note: While the Gluten Solution Program itself is not specifically designed for people with celiac disease, who must remain totally gluten free for life, the recipes in this book can be enjoyed by anyone with this condition (be sure to check labels on all ingredients carefully).<br><br>One important difference between the South Beach Diet Gluten Solution Program and some other gluten-free plans is the inclusion of non-gluten-containing whole grains. We do eliminate all grains on Phase 1 of the Gluten Solution Program, just as we do on Phase 1 of the original South Beach Diet, in order to stabilize your blood sugar and help you get a grip on cravings. But beginning on Gluten Solution Phase 2, we reintroduce healthy whole grains that don't contain gluten&#x2014;amaranth and buckwheat and brown rice, to name a few&#x2014;but do contain fiber, as well as vitamins and minerals that are hard to get in other foods. In addition, as always, our emphasis is on getting plenty of other good carbohydrates as well, such as vegetables, beans, and whole fruits.<br><br>Take a look at the glossary of ingredients that are used in this book, which begins on page 270. It will give you an overview of just how many naturally gluten-free foods you can choose from when planning meals from breakfasts to desserts. As you page through the recipes and look at all the taste-tempting photos, you'll quickly realize that gluten free doesn't mean giving up the foods you love, or sacrificing flavor or satisfaction.<br><br>What follows is a description of the Gluten Solution phases in a nutshell. For complete information on the program, you may want to read <i>The South Beach Diet Gluten Solution</i>, which offers complete food lists for each phase as well as additional recipes and meal plan ideas. You can also visit southbeachdiet.com/glutensolution for more information and support.<br><br>GLUTEN SOLUTION (GS) PHASE 1<br><br>If you have more than 10 �ds to lose and have cravings for sugar and starchy foods as well as symptoms of gluten sensitivity, you should start on GS Phase 1. During the 2 weeks on GS Phase 1, you won't be eating any wheat, barley, or rye, or products made from these grains, and you'll do your best to avoid products with gluten additives, such as certain types of soy products, imitation crabmeat, and blue cheese. In fact, as with the original South Beach Diet plan, you won't be eating any grains at all, or fruits for that matter, because we want you to get the blood sugar swings that cause your cravings under control. If that sounds difficult, don't worry. We have plenty of tasty, satisfying Phase 1-appropriate recipes in this book. You'll be losing weight fairly rapidly--up to 10 �ds in 2 weeks--and your gluten-sensitivity symptoms will begin to diminish and perhaps disappear. After 2 weeks you will move on to GS Phase 2 (see "If you are entering GS Phase 2 from GS Phase 1," below).<br><br>GLUTEN SOLUTION (GS) PHASE 2<br><br>If you have fewer than 10 �ds to lose and no cravings but do have gluten- sensitivity symptoms, you can begin the Gluten Solution Program on Phase 2 and stay gluten free--but not grain free--for 4 weeks. Your weight will drop steadily, although more slowly than if you were to have started on GS Phase 1, about 1 to 2 �ds a week. Since you don't have a lot of weight to lose, you can have three gluten-free starches and three servings of fruits per day the first week, utilizing the recipes in this book. If you aren't dropping 1 to 2 �ds a week, cut back on the number of starches and fruit servings. You will experiment with adding gluten back into your diet after being gluten free for 4 weeks, but you'll remain on GS Phase 2 until you reach a healthy weight.<br><br>If you are entering GS Phase 2 from GS Phase 1, you'll continue to stay gluten free for 2 more weeks, but you should gradually introduce gluten- free grains and fruits, working up to three servings of each per day over the 2-week period (if your weight loss stalls, cut back). You will experiment with adding gluten back into your diet after being gluten free for a total of 4 weeks, but you'll remain on GS Phase 2 until you reach a healthy weight.<br><br>If you have no weight to lose and no cravings, butn are experiencing gluten- sensitivity symptoms, you can do a modified GS Phase 2.This means you won't have to limit yourself to three gluten-free starches and three fruits a day, as is required for those with cravings or those who want to drop �ds. After 4 weeks of being gluten free, you move on to GS Phase 3.<br><br>No matter where you begin the Gluten Solution Program, at the end of 4 weeks on the program, gradually reintroduce some healthy, gluten-containing starches, swapping them for the gluten-free starches. (If you have been diagnosed with celiac disease, do not reintroduce gluten into your diet.) We recommend adding one gluten-containing food to your diet each day during the first week and carefully monitoring your reaction to it. If you're fine with one serving of gluten each day, you can add a second daily serving of a gluten-containing food the second week, working up to a maximum of three a day as the week progresses. You will know quickly if a food triggers symptoms (and/or cravings); if so, stop eating it. It may take a few weeks of trial and error to find your level of gluten tolerance, and you may discover that you aren't gluten sensitive at all.<br><br>GLUTEN SOLUTION (GS) PHASE 3<br><br>This is the maintenance phase of the Gluten Solution Program. You have achieved your healthy goal weight on GS Phase 2, you know what triggers your cravings and/ or your gluten-sensitivity symptoms, and you know how to make the right food choices for you. You have become gluten aware, not gluten phobic, and you know that no food is absolutely off-limits, unless you say it is.<br><br>All of the recipes in this book have been marked with the appropriate phase, depending on the ingredients a recipe contains. Remember, Phase 1 recipes can be included on Phase 2, and all can be enjoyed on Phase 3, whether you are on the Gluten Solution Program or the traditional South Beach Diet.<br><br>HOW TO USE THIS BOOK<br><br>For ease of use, we've organized this book the way most people like to cook, beginning with a variety of breakfast dishes, moving on to appetizers and snacks, then main dishes, and finally tantalizing desserts. For those who like lighter meals, there are chapters on soups and sandwiches, as well as salads, and for those who prefer not to eat meat, a chapter of meatless main dishes. The chapter on side dishes will prove very useful as you plan meals for the week.<br><br>As you look at the specific recipes, do so with an eye to what phase of the diet you're on. If you're on Gluten Solution Phase 1, for example, you'll be avoiding starches (bread, pasta, rice) and sugars (including fruits and fruit juice), just as you would on the traditional South Beach Diet program, but you'll still find plenty of satisfying recipes to choose from, including some Phase 2 recipes where we've simply swapped out an ingredient to make the recipe GS Phase 1 friendly (you'll see these marked Phase Switch). Once you're on GS Phase 2 or GS Phase 3, you can of course enjoy all the recipes in the book.<br><br>Every recipe features Hands-On Time (the active time you spend in the kitchen chopping, stirring, seasoning, and so on) and Total Time (how long it takes to make a dish from start to finish), including a notation if a dish needs to marinate or chill for any length of time. In addition, if a recipe can be made in 30 minutes or less, and more than half of the recipes in this book can, you'll see the icon, below, to indicate this.<br><br>30 MINUTES OR LESS<br><br>Where pertinent, you'll find tips for making the dishes ahead, along with suggestions on how to refrigerate or freeze finished dishes for future use. We have also provided ideas for turning one recipe into another (called Variations). For example, our Slow-Cooker Pulled Beef (page 186) could serve 12 for a party, or you can make it ahead, freeze it, and turn it into a variety of dishes like Beef Tostadas, Quick Beef Soup, Beefy Pasta, or Sloppy Joes. Our Green Lentil Salad (page 114) can easily become a main dish by adding whatever type of lean protein you prefer (we suggest pork). Also keep in mind that you always can alter a recipe to use what's seasonal or freshest at the market. If the cod or halibut looks better than the grouper, for example, use it in the California Fish Tacos (page 128). In summer, when peaches or strawberries are at their best, use one of them instead of apples in the Caramelized Apple Mini-Shortcakes (page 256).<br><br>Whichever recipes appeal to you, we suggest that you read through them in advance, plan a week's worth of menus, then make sure you have all the ingredients and equipment on hand (see page 13 for kitchen gear essentials). This will save you time and money too.<br><br>SURVEYING YOUR KITCHEN<br><br>The key to a healthy kitchen often lies in what's not in it rather than what is, and this is particularly true when you're embarking on a gluten- aware lifestyle. The first step is to take a good look at the contents of your cupboards, fridge, and freezer, and remove problem foods, particularly the highly processed sugary and starchy carbs&#x2014;the full-fat ice cream, the candy bars, the chips, the pretzels--that shouldn't be in any healthy eater's kitchen in the first place. The next step is to remove or put away all foods that contain gluten for 4 weeks if you're following the Gluten Solution Program. You won't need these foods for the recipes in this book anyway.<br><br>GLUTEN-FREE PHASE 1 DESSERTS<br><br>You'll be giving up all starches and fruits on Phase 1 of the Gluten Solution Program, but that doesn't mean you can't have dessert. Here are two of our South Beach Diet Phase 1 favorites. After 2 weeks on GS Phase 1, you'll be able to sample all the delicious gluten-free desserts found in this book, beginning on page 249.

Richards: Selected Essays (1929-1974)</h2><p>Bringing together essays that span the career of I.A. Richards--as both literary critic and pedagogue--this collection provides a much-needed re-introduction to a thinker whose works have been largely neglected of late. Carefully chosen, edited, and annotated, the selections make accessible a wide array of Richards's ideas on language and learning, focusing on his discussion of literacy, his critique of positivist linguistics, his explorations of C.S. Peirce's semiotics, and his theory of translation, which led not only to his well-known analysis of the structure and foundation of metaphor but to one of the earliest and most cogent formulations of reader-response theory. Berthoff's editing eliminates the distracting elements of Richards's style--the digressions and obscure allusions that have often hindered readers, and have in part contributed to the neglect his work has met with in recent years--while identifying and illuminating the chief principles of his critical thought and practice. Organized in four parts--Practical Criticism, The Philosophy of Rhetoric, The Meaning of Meaning, and Design for Escape--the book offers a lucid introduction to Richards's writings, with valuable headnotes to each section and a unique index of "speculative instruments" that examines the principal ideas Richards thought <em>with</em>. Readers are certain to find this volume essential to an understanding of Richards's "practical criticism," and invaluable in sharpening and re-directing their own thoughts on current linguistic practice, literary criticism, and educational theory.<br></p><p>Ivor Armstrong Richards (1893-1979) was an influential literary critic and rhetorician. Ann E. Berthoff is at University of Massachusetts (Emeritus)."A major accomplishment. Berthoff has provided access to one of the more complex and fruitful thinkers on language in the twentieth century....Makes it less likely that we will lose sight of a pivotal and crucial figure in twentieth-century rhetoric."--Journal of Advanced Composition<br><br>"Richards is arguably the most important...theorist in the history of composition/rhetoric....Berthoff vigorously and colorfully represents an important cluster of related theories and teaching practices."--College Composition and Communication<br><br>"The selection presents Richards as indeed a thinker who deserves to be taken seriously in his contribution to rhetoric and who deserves to be read. Berthoff's book is a good means to this end."--Virginia Quarterly Review<br><br>"Reveals a complex yet surprisingly clear view of language and learning that has far-reaching implications for all teachers of writing and literature....These selections should stimulate thoughtful re-examinations of our own positions on the important issues Richards addresses."--Freshman<br>English News<br><br>"An excellent edition for my students in the rhetorical theory course....A masterpiece of primary material for the undergraduate student."--Glenn Smith, University of Central Arkansas<br><br>"Its arrival is timely....The selections are significant contributions to current theory and practice."--David B. Merrell, Abilene Christian University<br><br>"Important for anyone concerned with structuralism, semiotics, reader response theory, or hermeneutics."--Gene Doty, University of Missouri, Rolla<br><br>"It would be impossible to overemphasize how judiciously Berthoff has edited and configured the texts of Richards on Rhetoric. It is not a book for casual reading, but for reading and rereading--an effort which is well repaid."--Semiotica</p><h2>Verilog HDL Synthesis, A Practical Primer</h2><p>With this book, you can: <p>- Start writing synthesizable Verilog models quickly. </p><p>- See what constructs are supported for synthesis and how these map to hardware so that you can get the desired logic. </p><p>- Learn techniques to help avoid having functional mismatches. </p><p>- Immediately start using many of the models for commonly used hardware elements described for your own use or modify these for your own application.</p></p><p>J.

The eponymous journal edited by Hubert Tonka brought together sociologists Jean Baudrillard, Ren� Lourau, and Catherine Cot, architects Jean Aubert, Jean-Paul Jungmann, Antoine Stinco, and landscape architect Isabelle Auricoste. Over the next decade, both in theory and in practice, the group articulated a radical ultra-leftist critique of architecture, urbanism, and everyday life. Utopia Deferred collects all of the essays Jean Baudrillard published in Utopie as well as recent interviews with Jean Baudrillard and Hubert Tonka.Utopie served as a workshop for Baudrillard's thought. Many of the essays he first published in Utopie were seminal for some of his most shockingly original books: For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign, The Mirror of Production, Simulations, Symbolic Exchange and Death, and In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities. But Utopie was also a topical journal and a political one; the topics of these essays are often torn from the headlines of the tumultuous decade following the uprisings of May 1968.</p></p><p>Jean Baudrillard (1929&#x2013;2007) was a philosopher, sociologist, cultural critic, and theorist of postmodernity who challenged all existing theories of contemporary society with humor and precision. An outsider in the French intellectual establishment, he was internationally renowned as a twenty-first century visionary, reporter, and provocateur.&#34;A symbiosis between a few architects and young intellectuals effectively occurred at the end of the 1960s. Their intention was to surpass architecture, just as urbanism had been surpassed and as the Situationists liquidated the university. Everyone within Utopie was trying to go as far as possible toward disappearance, just to see what would happen out there. We were looking for a point of intellectual gravity from which it would have been possible to radiate out to all disciplines.&#34; - Jean Baudrillard, Utopia Deferred&#34;</p><h2>The Story of God: A Narrative Theology</h2><p>Since its publication in 1994, The Story of God has played an important role in implementing and advancing the study of narrative theology. One of the first books to formulate and examine Wesleyan theology using the Bible&#x2019;s overarching story, it continues to serve as a popular text in colleges and universities and as a reliable resource for ministers and theologians.Unlike other books, which use a topical or systematic approach to understanding theology, The Story of God uses the flesh-and-blood stories of the Bible to help readers see the complete picture of God s love for the world and in doing so, gain a better understanding and appreciation for the Christian faith. Updated and revised to include current language and ideologies, this new edition provides readers with an even more engaging and accessible introduction to Christian theology. Drawing from Scripture, everyday experience, and contemporary reflection, Michael Lodahl weaves together the stories and themes of the Bible to present a compelling picture of the grand story of God and the amazing love He has for His people.</p><p>MICHAEL LODAHL is a professor of theology at Point Loma Nazarene University.

It is the purpose of the present volume to answer the need for such a guide. The book fulfills this purpose by organizing for the first time in easy reference form the assorted bits and pieces of information included in earlier books about netsuke. At the same time it approaches the subject from the point of view of the amateur collector rather than that of an owner discussing his own accomplished collection. Ever since Japan's emergence a little over a century ago from her long period of seclusion under Tokugawa rule, netsuke have exerted an<br>almost irresistible attraction for Western collectors. These tiny carvings-exquisite in detail, charming in conception, and delightful for the<br>sheer tactual pleasure to be experienced in handling them-captivated admirers of Japanese art and craftsmanship. Basically, netsuke were utilitarian in purpose, for they were designed to serve as pendants or toggles to support medi-<br>cine boxes, writing cases, smoking equipment, and similar articles worn suspended by a cord from the obi-a practical device since the kimono had no pockets. At first quite primitive in design, they soon became more and more sophisticated, and their carvers turned increasingly to the lege ndry of Japan and China for inspiration and subject matter. As J apanese costume became ever more Westernized, however, netsuke went out of fashion and, almost simultaneously, became the object of intensive sea rch by collectors and museums. That the search continues-and that the interest in netsuke is a developing one-is proved not only by remarkable increases in the prices of<br>genuine netsuke but also by the recent appearance of more and more literature dealing with these charming products of Japanese craftsmanship.

In <i>A Vast Machine</i> Paul Edwards has news for these skeptics: without models, there are no data. Today, no collection of signals or observations -- even from satellites, which can "see" the whole planet with a single instrument -- becomes global in time and space without passing through a series of data models. Everything we know about the world's climate we know through models. Edwards offers an engaging and innovative history of how scientists learned to understand the atmosphere -- to measure it, trace its past, and model its future.</p></p><p>Paul N.

She brilliantly analyzes Lacan&#x2019;s investigation of psychoanalysis not as dogma but as an ongoing self-critical process of discovery. By focusing on Lacan&#x2019;s singular way of making Freud&#x2019;s thought new again&#x2015;and of thus enabling us to participate in the very moment of intellectual struggle and insight&#x2015;Felman shows how this moment of illumination has become crucial to contemporary thinking and has redefined insight as such. This book is a groundbreaking statement not only on Lacan but on psychoanalysis in general.</p><p>Felman argues that, contrary to popular opinion, Lacan&#x2019;s preoccupation is with psychoanalytic practice rather than with theory for its own sake. His true clinical originality consists not in the incidental innovations that separate his theory from other psychoanalytic schools, but in the insight he gives us into the structural foundations of what is common to the practice of all schools: the transference action and the psychoanalytic dialogue. In chapters on Poe&#x2019;s tale &#x201c;The Purloined Letter&#x201d;; Sophocles&#x2019;s Oedipus plays, a case report by Melanie Klein, and Freud&#x2019;s writings, Felman demonstrates Lacan&#x2019;s rediscovery of these texts as renewed and renewable intellectual adventures and as parables of the psychoanalytic encounter. The book explores these questions: How and why does psychoanalytic practice work? What accounts for clinical success? What did Freud learn from the literary Oedipus, and how does Freud text take us beyond Oedipus? How does psychoanalysis inform, and radically displace, our conception of what learning is and of what reading is?</p><p>This book will be an intellectual event not only for clinicians and literary critics, but also for the broader audience of readers interested in contemporary thought.</p></p><p>Shoshana Felman is the Thomas E. Donnelly Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Yale University. Her books include <i>Testimony: Crises of Witnessing in Literature, Psychoanalysis and History</i>.&#x201c;This is the best book in English about Lacan. Felman gives us, with the clarity and precision of a master teacher, Lacan&#x2019;s vision of Freud&#x2019;s discovery in all its scope and depth. After reading Felman, not only will we read Lacan differently, we will read Freud differently.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John P. Muller</b><br><br>&#x201c;Of the major voices creating the astonishing, sometimes overbearing, onrush of French thought in recent decades, none has been harder to accommodate than that of Jacques Lacan. Shoshana Felman&#x2019;s generous invitation to her reader to participate in her encounter of Lacan&#x2019;s work does not make our introduction to the work easy, but she may well, for the first time, make it happen. She enacts the opening double message of the encounter of psychoanalysis with philosophy: that the difficulties in reading the originality of another are not barriers to the other but paths toward it; and that the encounter of reading is not a matter of putting on another&#x2019;s achievements but a process of taking on one&#x2019;s own change. In thus repaying her debt to Lacan, Shoshana Felman places us in hers.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stanley Cavell</b></p><h2>The Musical Experience</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Musical Experience</em></strong> is a <em>seamlessly integrated enhanced learning package</em> that features a thematic approach to music appreciation - each theme is described along a historical timeline.</p><p>Whether it is Music to Celebrate, Music from the Stage, or Music for Mourning, the reader will associate the music presented in <strong><em>The Musical Experience</em></strong> with a life moment - <strong>enhancing the experience!</strong></p><p>To resonate with today&#x2019;s music appreciation students and instructors, John Chiego has updated <strong><em>The Musical Experience</em></strong> with contemporary examples of musical selections, musicals, and music from the movies since 2000.</p><p>To meet the evolving needs of music appreciation students and instructors, John Chiego has integrated::</p><ul><li>Features an easy-to-read conversational writing style that is <strong>suitable for students with diverse backgrounds and experience</strong>.</li><li><strong>Multiple delivery options!</strong> This complete course package with a print/eBook text and <strong>optional online music library</strong> and accompanying <strong>website supplements</strong> make it ideal for face-to-face, hybrid, and distance learning settings.</li><li><strong>Real-time assessments throughout!</strong><em>Biographical Spotlights</em>, <em>Listening Exercise </em>questions, chapter question assignments, and <em>What Makes Music</em> features provide gradable components that can be completed by the reader on an ongoing basis throughout the semester.</li><li><strong>Includes Interactive Listening Charts</strong> that help readers with historical periods, genre, type of piece, and composer.</li><li><strong>Encourages self discovery!&nbsp; </strong>Students can access accompanying textbook playlists on the optional online music as well as create their own lists to expand their own listening library.</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>The Big Ditch: How America Took, Built, Ran, and Ultimately Gave Away the Panama Canal</h2><p><p>On August 15, 1914, the Panama Canal officially opened for business, forever changing the face of global trade and military power, as well as the role of the United States on the world stage. The Canal's creation is often seen as an example of U.S. triumphalism, but Noel Maurer and Carlos Yu reveal a more complex story. Examining the Canal's influence on Panama, the United States, and the world, <i>The Big Ditch</i> deftly chronicles the economic and political history of the Canal, from Spain's earliest proposals in 1529 through the final handover of the Canal to Panama on December 31, 1999, to the present day.</p><br><p> The authors show that the Canal produced great economic dividends for the first quarter-century following its opening, despite massive cost overruns and delays. Relying on geographical advantage and military might, the United States captured most of these benefits. By the 1970s, however, when the Carter administration negotiated the eventual turnover of the Canal back to Panama, the strategic and economic value of the Canal had disappeared. And yet, contrary to skeptics who believed it was impossible for a fledgling nation plagued by corruption to manage the Canal, when the Panamanians finally had control, they switched the Canal from a public utility to a for-profit corporation, ultimately running it better than their northern patrons.</p><br><p> A remarkable tale, <i>The Big Ditch</i> offers vital lessons about the impact of large-scale infrastructure projects, American overseas interventions on institutional development, and the ability of governments to run companies effectively.</p></p><p><p>"Meticulously researched and brilliantly argued, <i>The Big Ditch</i> provides a seminal analysis of the economic motivations and consequences of American imperialism. The book is not just about the Panama Canal, but also much more broadly about the nature and legacy of Western colonialism. It will force many of us to rethink what we thought we knew."<b>--James Robinson, coauthor of <i>Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy</i></b></p><p>"Why did the United States build the Panama Canal at tremendous cost in lives and treasure, and then give it away to the Panamanians? What exactly did we do with the Canal when we owned it? Did it make money or was it a boondoggle? Read this fascinating book and learn the answers."<b>--Stephen Haber, Stanford University</b></p><p>"This landmark book offers important new insights that will significantly advance our understanding of the national and global economic consequences of the Panama Canal. It will have a profound and lasting impact on the history of U.S. imperialism in Latin America and represents a contribution to the emergent literature on the new political economy of empire."<b>--Alan Dye, Barnard College, Columbia University</b></p><p>"This dynamic and entertaining book provides the first modern and quantitative interpretation of the economic and political history of the Panama Canal, one of the largest infrastructure works ever connected to the creation of a new country, the prevention of malaria and yellow fever, the reduction of transport prices, the promotion of international trade, and the redistribution of wealth in the United States."<b>--Xavier Duran, London School of Economics and Political Science and Northwestern University</b></p><b>Noel Maurer</b> is associate professor of business administration at Harvard Business School.

A 1950s bondo-spackled Dodge surged through a driving rain, veering around the potholes and upturned tracks of the abandoned Red Line trains on Alameda. Mama was in the front seat. My father was at the wheel. My brother <i>Rano</i> and I sat on one end of the back seat; my sisters <i>Pata</i> and <i>Cuca</i> on the other. There was a space between the boys and girls to keep us apart. </p><p> <i>"Am�, mira a Rano,"</i> a voice said for the tenth time from the back of the car. "He's hitting me again." </p><p> We fought all the time. My brother, especially, had it in for <i>La Pata</i> -- thinking of Frankenstein, he called her "Anastein." Her real name was Aha, but most of the time we went by the animal names Dad gave us at birth. I am <i>Grillo,</i> which means cricket. <i>Rano</i> stands for "rana," the frog. <i>La Pata</i> is the duck and <i>Cuca</i> is short for <i>cucaracha:</i> cockroach. </p><p> The car seats came apart in strands. I looked out at the passing cars which seemed like ghosts with headlights rushing past the streaks of water on the glass. I was nine years old. As the rain fell, my mother cursed in Spanish intermixed with pleas to saints and <i>"la Sant�sima Madre de Dios."</i> She argued with my father. Dad didn't curse or raise his voice. He just stated the way things were. </p><p> "I'll never go back to Mexico," he said. "I'd rather starve here. You want to stay with me, it has to be in Los Angeles. Otherwise, go." We were on the way to the Union train station in downtown L.A. We had our few belongings stuffed into the trunk and underneath our feet. I gently held on to one of the comic books Mama bought to keep us entertained. I had on my Sunday best clothes with chewed gum stuck in a coat pocket. It could have been Easter, but it was a weeping November. I don't remember for sure why we were leaving. I just knew it was a special day. There was no fear or concern on my part. We were always moving. I looked at the newness of the comic book and felt some exhilaration of its feel in my hand. Mama had never bought us comic books before. It had to be a special day. </p><p> For months we had been pushed from one house to another, just Mama and us children. Mom and Dad had split up prior to this. We stayed at the homes of women my mom called <i>comadres,</i> with streams of children of their own. Some nights we slept in a car or in the living rooms of people we didn't know. There were no shelters for homeless families. My mother tried to get us settled somewhere but all indications pointed to our going back to the land of her birth, to her red earth, her Mexico. </p><p> The family consisted of my father Alfonso, my mom Mar�a Estela, my older brother, Jos� Ren�, and my younger sisters, Ana Virginia and Gloria Estela. I recall my father with his wavy hair and clean-shaven face, his correct, upright and stubborn demeanor, in contrast to my mother who was heavy-set with Native features and thick straight hair, often laughing heartily, her eyes narrowed to slits, and sometimes crying from a deep tomb-like place with a sound like swallowing mud. </p><p> As we got closer to the Union station, Los Angeles loomed low and large, a city of odd construction, a good place to get lost in. I, however, would learn to hide in imaginative worlds -- in books; in TV shows, where I picked up much of my English; in solitary play with mangled army men and crumpled toy trucks. I was so withdrawn it must have looked scary. </p><p> This is what I know: When I was two years old, our family left Ciudad Ju�rez, Chihuahua, for Los Angeles. My father was an educated man, unusual for our border town, a hunger city filled to the hills with cardboard hovels of former peasants, Indians and dusk-faced children. In those days, an educated man had to be careful about certain things -- questioning authority, for example. Although the principal of a local high school, my father failed to succumb to the local chieftains who were linked to the national party which ruled Mexico, as one famous Latin American writer would later say, with a "perfect dictatorship." </p><p> When Dad first became principal, there were no funds due to the massive bureaucratic maze he had to get through to get them. The woman he lived with then was an artist who helped raise money for the school by staging exhibitions. My father used his own money to pay for supplies and at one point had the iron fence around the school tom down and sold for scrap. </p><p> One year, Dad received an offer for a six-month study program for foreign teachers in Bloomington, Indiana. He liked it so much, he renewed it three times. By then, my father had married his secretary, my mother, after the artist left him. They had their first child, Jos� Ren�. </p><p> By the time my father returned, his enemies had mapped out a means to remove him -- being a high school principal is a powerful position in a place like Ciudad Juarez. My father faced a pile of criminal charges, including the alleged stealing of school funds. Police arrived at the small room in the <i>vecindad</i> where Mama and Dad lived and escorted him to the city jail. </p><p> For months my father fought the charges. While he was locked up, they fed him scraps of food in a rusted steel can. They denied him visitors -- Mama had to climb a section of prison wall and pick up 2-year-old Jos� Ren� so he could see his father. Finally, after a lengthy trial, my father was found innocent -- but he no longer had his position as principal. </p><p> Dad became determined to escape to the United States. My mother, on the other hand, never wanted to leave Mexico; she did it to be with Dad. </p><p> Mama was one of two daughters in a family run by a heavy-drinking, wife-beating railroad worker and musician. My mother was the only one in her family to complete high school. Her brothers, Kiko and Rodolfo, often crossed the border to find work and came back with stories of love and brawls on the other side. </p><p> Their grandmother was a Tarahumara Indian who once walked down from the mountainous area in the state of Chihuahua where her people lived in seclusion for centuries. The Spanish never conquered them. But their grandmother never returned to her people. She eventually gave birth to my grandmother, Aha Acosta. </p><p> Ana's first husband was a railroad worker during the Mexican Revolution; he lost his life when a tunnel exploded during a raid. They brought his remains in a box. Aha was left alone with one son, while pregnant with a daughter. Lucita, the daughter, eventually died of convulsions at the age of four, and Manolo, the son, was later blinded after a bout with a deadly form of chicken pox which struck and killed many children in the area. </p><p> Later Aha married my grandfather, M�nico Jim�nez, who like her first husband worked the railroads. At one point, M�nico quit the rails to play trumpet and sing for bands in various night clubs. Once he ended up in Los Angeles, but with another woman. In fact, M�nico had many other women. My grandmother often had to cross over to the railroad yards, crowded with prostitutes and where M�nico spent many nights singing, to bring him home. </p><p> When my parents married, Mama was 27; Dad almost 40. She had never known any other man. He already had four or five children from three or four other women. She was an emotionally-charged, border woman, full of fire, full of pain, full of giving love. He was a stoic, unfeeling, unmoved intellectual who did as he pleased as much as she did all she could to please him. This dichotomous couple, this sun and moon, this <i>curandera</i> and biologist, dreamer and realist, fire woman and water man, molded me; these two sides created a life-long conf</p></p><h2>Side by Side 2 Student Book 2 w/ Audio Highlights</h2><p>Side by Side has helped more than 25 millions students worldwide persist and succeed as language learners!

It's a state of continual alertness. Often, after I've glanced at a story in the paper and skipped rapidly over the familiar rubble of falsification, a week or two later will drop into my mailbox a photocopy of that same story marked up by Chomsky, with sentences underlined and a phrase or two in the margin etched deep into the paper by an angry pen. </p><p>What Chomsky offers is a coherent "big picture," buttressed by the data of a thousand smaller pictures and discrete theaters of conflict, struggle and oppression.... For hundreds of thousands of people--over the years, he must have spoken to more American students than any person alive--Chomsky has offered the assurance, the intellectual and moral authority, that there is another way of looking at things. In this vital function he stands in the same relationship to his audience as did a philosopher he admires greatly, Bertrand Russell. </p><p>-Alexander Cockburn, from his introduction "Excavating the Truth"</p></p><p>Noam Chomsky is Institute Professor of Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and is the author of many books on U.S. foreign policy.&#34;If you assume that there&#39;s no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope.

In this book, Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor who is black, applies his precise command of the relevant legal language and legal background to explain and evaluate for the general reader various current ideas about how race is and should be involved in meting out criminal justice. His basic stance is that liberals and conservatives have more common ground on race and law than it seems at first, and that blacks have suffered more from being underprotected by law enforcement than from being mistreated as suspects or defendants, even though it is the latter allegation that seems to draw the most attention from those who view the courts through racial lenses.<b>Randall Kennedy</b>&nbsp;is the Michael R.

John Abramson, M.D., an award-winning family doctor on the clinical faculty at Harvard Medical School, reveals, in the same clear language that he used with his patients, how the corporate takeover of clinical research and medical practice is compromising Americans' health. You -- and your doctor -- will be stunned by his findings.</p><p>For twenty years, Dr. Abramson cared for patients of all ages in a small town north of Boston. But increasingly his role as family doctor was undermined as pressure mounted to use the latest drugs and high-tech solutions for nearly every problem. Drawing on his background in statistics and health policy research, he began to investigate the radical changes that were quietly taking place in American medicine.</p><p>At the heart of the crisis, he found, lies the changed purpose of medical knowledge -- from seeking to optimize health to searching for the greatest profits. The lack of transparency that has become normal in commercially sponsored medical research now taints the scientific evidence published in even our most prestigious medical journals. And unlike the recent scandals in other industries that robbed Americans of money and jobs, this one is undermining our health.</p><p>The hormone replacement debacle, it turns out, is not an isolated case. The same kind of commercial distortion now pervades the information that doctors rely upon to guide the prevention and treatment of common health problems, from heart disease to stroke, osteoporosis, diabetes, and osteoarthritis.</p><p>The good news, as Dr. Abramson explains, is that the real scientific evidence shows that many of the things that you can do to protect and preserve your own health are far more effective than what the drug companies' top-selling products can do for you -- which is why the drug companies work so hard to keep this information under wraps.</p><p>In what is sure to be one of the most important and eye-opening books you or your doctor will ever read, John Abramson offers conclusive evidence that American medicine has broken its promise to best improve our health and is squandering more than $500 billion each year in the process.</p><p>Isn't it time to learn the facts, discuss these issues with your doctor, and reclaim the good health and medical care that all Americans deserve?</p></p><p><p>John Abramson, M.D., has worked as a family doctor in Appalachia and in Hamilton, Massachusetts, and has served as chairman of the department of family practice at Lahey Clinic. He was a Robert Wood Johnson Fellow and is on the clinical faculty of Harvard Medical School, where he teaches primary care.</p>According to Abramson, Americans are overmedicated and overmedicalized as a result of the commercialization of health care. Falling prey to marketing campaigns, we demand unnecessary and expensive drugs and procedures, believing they constitute the best possible medical care. Wrong, says Abramson: though more post&#x2013;heart attack procedures are performed in the U.S. than in Canada, one-year survival rates are the same. Similarly, notes Abramson, a former family practitioner who teaches at Harvard Medical School, we spend more on high-tech neonatology than other Western countries but have a higher infant-mortality rate because of inattention to low-tech prenatal care. Abramson deconstructs the scientific sleight of hand in presenting clinical trial results that leads to the routine prescription of pricey cholesterol-lowering drugs even when their effectiveness has not been proven; he examines what he calls "supply-sensitive medical services"&#x2014;the near-automatic use of medical technologies, such as cardiac catheterization, less because they are needed than because they are available. Abramson's bottom line: "More care doesn't necessarily mean better care." Arguing firmly that doctors should focus more on lifestyle changes to improve health, Abramson seems less credible when he writes off depression as "exercise-deficiency disease" and disposes of cancer in little more than a page. Still, he makes a powerful and coherent case that American medicine has gone badly astray and needs a new paradigm&#x2014;one untainted by profits. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book goes beyond the mere description of style to show how that style works in concert with the cultural context to create meaning in the art. The volume provides readers with an efficient and workable educational tool with which to study the art from this large part of the world. <b> </b> Art from Africa, India and Southeast Asia, China, Korea and Japan, the Pacific, Pre-Columbia and Native America are examined as well as art without boundaries. <b> </b> For art enthusiasts and others interested in a one-volume analysis of non-Western art. </p></p><p><p> In this first major survey of the arts of Africa, India and Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Korea, the Pacific, and the Americas, Michael Kampen O'Riley presents the vast and fascinating range of arts that lie outside the Western tradition. Within a predominantly geographic and chronological framework, he explores the arts of these areas from the beginnings of civilization to the present day. </p> <p> As early as the Renaissance, European collectors were enjoying "exotic" pieces from Asia, Africa, and the Americas. But it was not until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that Europeans began to pay serious attention to the spectacular art and architecture they found abroad. With the accumulation of knowledge, each of these arts began to be recognized and appreciated in its own terms. Using maps, time charts, and a wide selection of famous and lesser known images, the author charts this growing awareness region by region, analyzing individual art works within their cultural contexts. The book's final chapter focuses on the increasing interrelation between all these cultures during the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. The effects of postcolonialism, postmodernism, and internationalism are acknowledged as instrumental in the creation of new hybrid art forms that draw their inspiration both from specific cultural traditions and the contemporary world at large. </p><p> <b><i>Michael Kampen O'Riley</i></b> gained his Ph.D. in the History of Art from the University of Pennsylvania and worked at Yale University with George Kubler on the Tikal Project Reports.

(<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"A valuable foundation for understanding how prediction has suffused policing, in much the same way it has suffused the rest of society. Ferguson's criticisms are cogent, but more importantly he communicates clearly a broad factual picture of the situation as it stands today." (<i>The Washington Free Beacon</i>)<br><br>"In this timely, informative and at times disturbing book, Andrew Ferguson exposes the promises and perils of big data for policing and privacy. This critically important work provides a comprehensive account of how big data can help police solve crime and enhance police accountability and oversight. However, the book simultaneously exposes how the use of big data to inform policing practices can mask, reify and reinforce racial bias under the cloak of objectivity. The Rise of Big Data Policing is a must read for judges, policymakers, advocates, activists, and anyone else who wants to understand what big data is and how it is transforming our criminal justice institutions, the law, and our privacy expectations in surprising and disturbing ways that should concern us all."

At stake is nothing less than individual liberty and the democratic control of policing."</p>" (Jeffrey Fagan,Isidor and Seville Sulzbacher Professor of Law, Columbia University)<br><br>"Ferguson has an incredible command of the many subjects that fall under the 'big data' umbrella, and his writing is at its best when social, cultural, and technological dynamics coalesce into one story. The book is particularly strong when Ferguson takes on how classism and racism shape smart policing datasets, which epitomize how 'big data' policing is held back by the many limitations of larger legal structures but is presented as the solution to that very problem." (<i>Gizmodo</i>)<br><br>"In an important book that goes to the heart of issues at the forefront of contemporary life, Ferguson examines how police departments are now using supposedly 'objective'data-driven surveillance technologies to work more effectively in a budget-cutting era and to avoid claims of racial bias. In this engaging, well-written narrative, based on studies and a deep understanding of policing, [Ferguson] describes the growing police use of shareddata, its effects on how and where police work, and its usefulness in predicting future criminals . . .Essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how technology is changing American policing." (<i>STARRED Kirkus Review</i>)<br><br>"The first-ever comprehensive overview, The Rise of Big Data Policing strikes an adept balance in covering both the promise and the peril of predictive policing. . . .

Valuable for the critical civil rights and constitutional issues it raises." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Andrew Ferguson has written a path-breaking book about a crucial civil rights struggle of our time. The more law enforcement automates its work, the more minority communities are getting caught in a pernicious web of surveillance and punishment.

Here, in <i>Faust</i>, <i>Part 1</i>, the tremendous versatility of Goethe's genius creates some of the most beautiful passages in literature.

But even more impressive than his versatility was his unwillingness ever to settle into a single style or approach; whenever he used a literary form, he made of it something new.<br><br>Born in 1749 to a well-to-do family in Frankfurt, he was sent to Strasbourg to earn a law degree. There, he met the poet-philosopher Herder, discovered Shakespeare, and began to write poetry. His play <i>G�tz von Berlichingen</i> (1773) made him famous throughout Germany. He was invited to the court of the duke of Sachsen-Weimar, where he quickly became a cabinet minister. In 1774 his novel of Romantic melancholy, <i>The Sorrows of a Young Werther</i>, electrified all of Europe. Soon as he was at work on the first version of his <b>Faust</b>, which would finally appear as a fragment in 1790.<br><br>In the 1780s Goethe visited England and immersed himself in classical poetry. The next decade saw the appearance of <i>Wihelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</i>, his novel of a young artist education, and a wealth of poetry and criticism. He returned to the Faust material around the turn of the century and completed Part 1 in 1808.<br><br>The later years of his life were devoted to a bewildering array of pursuits: research in botany and in a theory of colors, a novel (<i>Elective Affinities</i>), the evocative poems of the <i>West-Easters Divan</i>, and his great autobiography, <i>Poetry and Truth</i>.

In this book, Morten Christiansen and Nick Chater argue that to understand this astonishing phenomenon, we must consider how language is created: moment by moment, in the generation and understanding of individual utterances; year by year, as new language learners acquire language skills; and generation by generation, as languages change, split, and fuse through the processes of cultural evolution. Christiansen and Chater propose a revolutionary new framework for understanding the evolution, acquisition, and processing of language, offering an integrated theory of how language creation is intertwined across these multiple timescales.</p><p>Christiansen and Chater argue that mainstream generative approaches to language do not provide compelling accounts of language evolution, acquisition, and processing. Their own account draws on important developments from across the language sciences, including statistical natural language processing, learnability theory, computational modeling, and psycholinguistic experiments with children and adults. Christiansen and Chater also consider some of the major implications of their theoretical approach for our understanding of how language works, offering alternative accounts of specific aspects of language, including the structure of the vocabulary, the importance of experience in language processing, and the nature of recursive linguistic structure.</p></p><p>Morten H.

Drawing on more than ten years of fieldwork among the Yolngu&#x2014;an Aboriginal people of Northeast Arnhem Land&#x2014;and applying both anthropological and art historical methods, Howard Morphy explores systematically the graphic representation of traditional knowledge in Yolngu art. He also charts the role that art has played in Aboriginal society both present and past.<br> <br> The rich symbolism of Yolngu art links the Yolngu directly with the "Dreaming," the time of world-creation that continues as the spiritual dimension of the present. Morphy shows how a complex dialectic of "inside" and "outside" interpretations of painting structures the system of knowledge in Yolngu society, and how European interest in this art has caused certain changes in the conditions of its production. The "inside" significance of the art, however, has not changed; it retains its dual ability to represent and to constitute relationships between things.<br> <br> <i>Ancestral Connections</i> is a major contribution to the anthropology of art. A subtle commentary on the colonial encounter in northern Australia, the book demonstrates how the Yolngu have used their art&#x2014;against all odds&#x2014;as an instrument of cultural survival and as a component of the economic and political transformation of their society.<br> <br></p></p><p></p><h2>Band of Giants: The Amateur Soldiers Who Won America&#39;s Independence</h2><p><i>Band of Giants </i>brings to life the founders who fought for our independence in the Revolutionary War. Jefferson, Adams, and Franklin are known to all; men like Morgan, Greene, and Wayne are less familiar. Yet the dreams of the politicians and theorists only became real because fighting men were willing to take on the grim, risky, brutal work of war. We know Fort Knox, but what about Henry Knox, the burly Boston bookseller who took over the American artillery at the age of 25? Eighteen counties in the United States commemorate Richard Montgomery, but do we know that this revered martyr launched a full-scale invasion of Canada? The soldiers of the American Revolution were a diverse lot: merchants and mechanics, farmers and fishermen, paragons and drunkards. Most were ardent amateurs. Even George Washington, assigned to take over the army around Boston in 1775, consulted books on military tactics. Here, Jack Kelly vividly captures the fraught condition of the war&#x2015;the bitterly divided populace, the lack of supplies, the repeated setbacks on the battlefield, and the appalling physical hardships. That these inexperienced warriors could take on and defeat the superpower of the day was one of the remarkable feats in world history.</p><p>Jack Kelly is a journalist, novelist, and historian. He has contributed to <i>American Heritage, American Legacy, Invention &amp; Technology, </i>among other national periodicals, is a New York Foundation for the Arts fellow in Nonfiction Literature, as well as author of <i>Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive That Changed the World</i>. He has appeared on The History Channel , been interviewed on National Public Radio , and conducted book signings across the country. He lives near Kingston in New York's Hudson Valley, where much of the action of the Revolutionary War took place.<p>&#x201c;A highly engaging read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Lively narrative of the Revolutionary War realistically assesses the motley collection of men who led the military struggle against Britain, revealing both their strengths and weaknesses.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;With vivid details and incisive characterizations, Jack Kelly tells how unlikely young Americans--an asthmatic Quaker with a limp, an overweight bookseller, a barely literate backwoods wagon master--discovered in 1776 an ability to outthink and outfight the generals and soldiers of the best army in the world. Readers will finish this fascinating book with a sense of awe--and a renewed faith in America's ability to overcome daunting challenges.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Thomas Fleming, author of Liberty! The American Revolution</i></p><p>&#x201c;Jack Kelly has written a superb account of the American soldiers who won our independence against great odds. <i>Band of Giants</i> is a masterfully descriptive account of their experiences that tells us, in his wonderful style, who these remarkable men were. This is a must read for all Americans who want to truly know those who forged our magnificent nation.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>General Anthony C. Zinni USMC (Retired)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Armed with the latest research burnished by a bright, brisk writing style, Jack Kelly has done a masterful job of retelling the story of the Revolutionary War by focusing on the key figures and battles of the long-protracted military struggle that undergirded the political war for independence.

Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p>Surely no stranger work exists in the annals of protest literature than <i>The Master and Margarita</i>. Written during the Soviet crackdown of the 1930s, when Mikhail Bulgakov's works were effectively banned, it wraps its anti-Stalinist message in a complex allegory of good and evil. Or would that be the other way around? The book's chief character is Satan, who appears in the guise of a foreigner and self-proclaimed black magician named Woland. Accompanied by a talking black tomcat and a "translator" wearing a jockey's cap and cracked pince-nez, Woland wreaks havoc throughout literary Moscow. First he predicts that the head of noted editor Berlioz will be cut off; when it is, he appropriates Berlioz's apartment. (A puzzled relative receives the following telegram: "Have just been run over by streetcar at Patriarch's Ponds funeral Friday three afternoon come Berlioz.") Woland and his minions transport one bureaucrat to Yalta, make another one disappear entirely except for his suit, and frighten several others so badly that they end up in a psychiatric hospital. In fact, it seems half of Moscow shows up in the bin, demanding to be placed in a locked cell for protection. <p> Meanwhile, a few doors down in the hospital lives the true object of Woland's visit: the author of an unpublished novel about Pontius Pilate. This Master--as he calls himself--has been driven mad by rejection, broken not only by editors' harsh criticism of his novel but, Bulgakov suggests, by political persecution as well. Yet Pilate's story becomes a kind of parallel narrative, appearing in different forms throughout Bulgakov's novel: as a manuscript read by the Master's indefatigable love, Margarita, as a scene dreamed by the poet--and fellow lunatic--Ivan Homeless, and even as a story told by Woland himself. Since we see this narrative from so many different points of view, who is truly its author? Given that the Master's novel and this one end the same way, are they in fact the same book? These are only a few of the many questions Bulgakov provokes, in a novel that reads like a set of infinitely nested Russian dolls: inside one narrative there is another, and then another, and yet another. His devil is not only entertaining, he is <i>necessary</i>: "What would your good be doing if there were no evil, and what would the earth look like if shadows disappeared from it?"</p><p> Unsurprisingly--in view of its frequent, scarcely disguised references to interrogation and terror--Bulgakov's masterwork was not published until 1967, almost three decades after his death. Yet one wonders if the world was really ready for this book in the late 1930s, if, indeed, we are ready for it now. Shocking, touching, and scathingly funny, it is a novel like no other. Woland may reattach heads or produce 10-ruble notes from the air, but Bulgakov proves the true magician here. <i>The Master and Margarita</i> is a different book each time it is opened. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>The devil, disguised as a magician, descends upon Moscow in the 1930s with his riotous band, which includes a talking cat and an expert assassin. Together they succeed in comically befuddling a population which denies the devil&#39;s existence, even as it is confronted with the diabolic results of a magic act gone wrong. This visit to the capital of world atheism has several aims, one of which concerns the fate of the Master, a writer who has written a novel about Pontius Pilate, and is now in a mental hospital. Margarita, the despairing and daring heroine, becomes a witch in an effort to save the Master, and agrees to become the devil&#39;s hostess at his annual spring ball. By turns acidly satiric, fantastic, and ironically philosophical, this work constantly surprises and entertains, as the action switches back and forth between the Moscow of the 1930s and first-century Jerusalem.</p><h2>A History of the Modern World</h2><p>Conceived and written as a history of the modern world rather than a truncated Western Civilization book, this text is one of the most highly praised history texts ever published.

That is because virtually all of today's technology is based, at least in part, on this knowledge. The basic subject material of what is called modern physics is very nearly 100 years old, so that it is hardly modern at all. Yet just as Newton's laws, today 300 years old, Maxwell's equations, today nearly 150 years old, and the laws of classical statistical physics, more than 100 years old, remain applicable and essential in their respective domains of physical law, so too do the two major developments of the first half of this century: relativity and quantum mechanics. These fundamental subjects underlie a vast scope of application that continues its inventive course today. Moreover, research on fundamental physics has not stopped with relativity and quantum mechanics, and working scientists still face questions as interesting as any that have been answered in the past. </p> <p> Both relativity and quantum mechanics require the student to make difficult changes in how he or she thinks the physical world works. The subjects violate prejudices that have been built up by everyday experience. For this reason, precision and clarity of explanation are, for us, the first and most important part of the material. We have made every effort to avoid the "it can be shown" approach and to present modern physics in a way that makes its interconnectedness, as well as its connection to classical physics, evident. </p> <p> Throughout this text, we have built in a historical approach - a discussion of how a subject developed and the thinking that led to its maturation. Often this historical perspective is interwoven with the material; at other times it would interrupt an efficient and compact presentation, and then we present it on the side, as it were. We feel that this approach is useful in that it stresses that the roots of the revolutionary advances lie in experiment; it also makes the text more fun to read. </p> <p> The book forms the basis of a traditional course in the subject. It contains, in a mathematical language that we have deliberately kept at a level we felt students would be comfortable with, descriptions of special relativity and of the laws of quantum mechanics. It describes applications of these fundamental ideas to both technological and scientific issues. Finally, it describes the subject matter that is of fundamental interest today. All this material is too much to cover in one semester, the usual length of time for such courses, so a more detailed explanation of what we do is in order. This will allow the instructor to make a reasonable choice of what to cover and provide guidance to the reader or the use of the material in the book. </p> <p> We have broken the material into several parts, even if the boundary between the coverage of the different parts is not always perfectly sharp. The first chapter replaces what would otherwise be a steady set of footnotes referring the reader to an introductory calculus-based textbook. In other words, Chapter 1 is a place to remind students of things that, ideally, they should have fully absorbed in their introductory courses. While the chapter cannot replace such a textbook, it can be a convenient road map to the introductory material. It also constitutes a type of formulary of classical physics. But we urge the student to keep his or her introductory text and to consult it when necessary. The chapter contains no examples or problems, and it is not meant to be assigned as normal course material. </p> <p> Part 1 consists of two chapters on special relativity. These are divided more or less according to traditional lines, with a discussion of space and time in one chapter and momentum and energy in the next. Our approach is to extract length contraction from the Michelson-Morley result and use it as a jumping off point for the other effects of special relativity, including the Lorentz transformations. This tack differs somewhat in detail, although not in spirit, from the approach that abstracts special relativity from a moving light-clock. We believe that the formal approach starting early with the full set of Lorentz transformations, less suitable for physicists and engineers than mathematicians, can miss the physics of the subject. We also save our discussion of general relativity for a much later chapter. Even though the origins of general relativity are old, there is much exciting current material to cover. </p> <p> Part 2 is a treatment of the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. This is a subject with a fascinating yet complex history, but we feel that the number of missteps in the development of quantum mechanics speak against a full historical interweaving of the material with the rest of the text. Thus a separate historical introduction is presented. Chapter 4 describes the experimental data that could not be encompassed by classical physics and examines the daring ideas that opened the gateway to the development of quantum mechanics. Bohr's approach to the structure of the hydrogen atom provided the critical breakthrough, and it merits a chapter on its own, Chapter 5. Extended to circular orbits for other central forces, that approach leads to the quantum nature of rotational and vibrational motion, and it also provides a useful tool for the dependence of energy levels on the relevant physical parameters. </p> <p> Chapter 6 introduces the Schrodinger equation. Here the problem is to find a way to present this material without getting too heavily into mathematics. One common approach is via wave packets, but they are something with which many students using this text may feel uncomfortable. Instead, we motivate the Schrodinger equation by using classical parallels and the physical meaning of a wave function to argue the form of the Schrodinger equation. This involves bringing in the probability interpretation of the wave function in what we feel is its proper place: right at the beginning. We have kept the mathematics involved in actually solving the Schrodinger equation low, treating just the infinite well here. Only in Chapter 7 do we go into the addition of plane waves with easily managed distributions to get at the concepts of wave packets and of probabilities for measurements of momentum. In that way we can understand the particlelike behavior of a superposition of waves. This material also allows us to introduce the uncertainty relations. We show how they "shield" quantum mechanics from contradictions, and we illustrate their utility in making estimates of ground-state energies. </p> <p> Starting with Chapter 8 we are in position to see what the Schrodinger equation has to say about some interesting potentials, namely barriers and wells. A good deal of useful physics about scattering and bound states can be conveyed for these mathematically simple situations. We pay particular attention to the physics of tunneling, relating it to internal reflection and to a demonstration that can actually be done in class and describing where it is relevant to physical phenomena. Chapter 9 is a discussion of the Schrodinger equation in the context of the coulomb potential. It is in this chapter that we treat angular momenta, even if we do not employ much in the way of mathematical rigor, and our discussion of the hydrogen atom is concentrated in this chapter, along with the Zeeman effect and the concept of spin. In Chapter 10 we conclude our discussion of the principles of quantum mechanics with the treatment of manybody systems and the symmetry of the wave function for identical particles. This subject is indispensable for an understanding of solids and other material systems, and by putting the exclusion principle here we are prepared for its applications in many domains. </p> <p> Part 3 of the book is labeled "applications," and it contains discussions of those areas, both in nature and in technology, that cannot be understood without quantum mechanics. The instructor can easily pick and choose among the chapters in this part of the text if he or she is pressed for time. Still, one needs to be aware that there are constraints in some cases; for example, it would be difficult to teach the physics of semiconductors without having first seen the Fermi-Dirac distribution. </p> <p> Part 3 begins (in Chapter 11) with a discussion of complex atoms and of molecules. We are primarily interested in the quantum mechanical basis of the periodic table, in the way that minima in energy are associated with the mechanisms by which atoms can form molecules, and in simple molecular spectra. The next chapter is a treatment of thermal systems, and because some of the students who take this course may not have had a good background in that material we begin with a simple treatment of classical statistical mechanics, an extremely useful subject for any future engineer or scientist. A treatment of specific heats allows us to understand why one needs a discussion of statistical quantum mechanics. The Boltzmann distribution, a major target, is not only extremely important on its own, it also provides a guide for the development of the quantum mechanical distributions for identical particles. In each case, very simple arguments based on the idea of thermal equilibrium are used. We can also make the connection back to the blackbody distribution first described in Chapter 4, closing a circle. </p> <p> In Chapter 13 we describe how one can think about unstable systems in quantum mechanics, a topic relevant to atoms in excited states and, by extension, to lasers, whose operation and use form a major part of the chapter. Chapter 14 describes applications to the solid state, a topic so large that we have been forced to make some restrictive choices. We have tried in part to choose according to topics of the greatest current interest to engineers. Accordingly, we have begun with a treatment of how electricity is conducted in materials. When this is coupled with the essential description of band structure, we are led in a natural way to the behavior of semicon...</p></p><h2>The Curse of Caste; or The Slave Bride: A Rediscovered African American Novel by Julia C. Collins</h2><p>In 1865, <em>The Christian Recorder</em>, the national newspaper of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, serialized <em>The Curse of Caste; or The Slave Bride</em>, a novel written by Mrs. Julia C. Collins, an African American woman living in the small town of Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The first novel ever published by a black American woman, it is set in antebellum Louisiana and Connecticut, and focuses on the lives of a beautiful mixed-race mother and daughter whose opportunities for fulfillment through love and marriage are threatened by slavery and caste prejudice. The text shares much with popular nineteenth-century women's fiction, while its dominant themes of interracial romance, hidden African ancestry, and ambiguous racial identity have parallels in the writings of both black and white authors from the period.<br>Begun in the waning months of the Civil War, the novel was near its conclusion when Julia Collins died of tuberculosis in November of 1865. In this first-ever book publication of <em>The Curse of Caste; or The Slave Bride</em>, the editors have composed a hopeful and a tragic ending, reflecting two alternatives Collins almost certainly would have considered for the closing of her unprecedented novel. In their introduction, the editors offer the most complete and current research on the life and community of an author who left few traces in the historical record, and provide extensive discussion of her novel's literary and historical significance. Collins's published essays, which provide intriguing glimpses into the mind of this gifted but overlooked writer, are included in what will prove to be the definitive edition of a major new discovery in African American literature. Its publication contributes immensely to our understanding of black American literature, religion, women's history, community life, and race relations during the era of United States emancipation.<br></p><p><br><strong>William L.

Featuring more than 500 A-Z articles, it throws new and often unexpected light on the most familiar of Dickens's works, and explores the experiences, events, and literature on which he drew. There is also a chronology of Dickens' life, a list of characters in his works, a list of entries by theme, a family tree, three maps, an invaluable bibliography, and a general index. <br><br>Compiled by a distinguished editorial team, and written in a lucid, easy style that would have pleased him, <em>The Oxford Companion to Charles Dickens</em> offers a more authoritative and accessible range of information than any other reference work on Dickens.<br>Aspects covered include: <br><br>The private man and the public figure - his family, friends, colleagues, and convictions <br><br>The age in which he lived and worked - the people, events, and institutions that informed his writing <br><br>The places that were significant to him - his homes, his London, and the countries he visited <br><br>The ideas and social theories of the time - the attitudes he satirized and the ideologies he advocated <br><br>The works on which his reputation rests - their history, structure, inspiration, and significance <br></p><p>This is a book where most redundant matter has been left out, and where a simple (and therefore memorable) yet comprehensive scheme of variations across the democratic phenomenon is presented and discussed ...

S. Eliot.<br>Like Poe before him and Conan Doyle after, Wilkie Collins shifted easily from rational domains to the &#x201c;superrational.&#x201d; Like them, he is famed for original contributions to &#x201c;ratiocinative&#x201d; (detective) literature, but often preferred to indulge his occult predilection &#x2014; a lifelong indulgence. His first published story, &#x201c;The Last Stage Coachmen&#x201d; (1843), was a supernatural allegory of trains; perhaps his last lucid effort (before ill health and opium drained his powers) was this short novel, <i>The Haunted Hotel.<br></i>Collins&#x2019; methods and themes, developed and elaborated in his earlier, massive novels, are streamlined and concentrated here into a tight novelette. The same relentless pace and narrative power, the same attention to plot and backdrop detail that distinguish <i>The Moonstone </i>and<i> The Woman in White</i> are evident here, as is the obsession with destiny and the willful struggle against it.<br>Collins&#x2019; much-loved Venice provides the scenery and fatal beauty, the grim waterways and palaces the author will haunt with mysterious women, grotesques, and bloody conspiracies. The Countess Narona is one of Collins&#x2019; cosmopolitan enchantresses; she acts, but as the tool of her doom. T. S. Eliot wrote, &#x201c;The principal character, the fatal woman, is herself obsessed by the idea of fatality; her motives are melodramatic; she therefore compels the coincidences to occur, feeling that she is compelled to compel them.&#x201d; Collins relieves the tension with some wry characterizations and ironies; the theatrics are sustained. Indeed, theatrical motifs figure heavily, Collins himself being much involved with the stage at that period.<br><i>The Haunted Hotel</i> appears to be loosely based on a case from the annals of French crime; the scene, scenery, players and conflicts, and especially the horror, come straight from Collins&#x2019; overstimulated, no doubt overwrought, most certainly haunted imagination.</p><p></p></p><p><br>A prolific author of the Victorian era, Wilkie Collins (1824-89) wrote "sensation" novels. The forerunners of today's detective and suspense fiction, his best-known works include <i>The Moonstone</i> and <i>The Woman in White</i>.<i> </i>Charles Dickens was his lifelong friend and collaborator, and many of Collins' stories first appeared in Dickens' weekly publication, <i>All the Year Round</i>.</p><h2>How to Repair Food</h2><p>You need never be embarrassed by bland, burned, or otherwise substandard food-and the book&#39;s a hoot to read, even if you haven&#39;t suffered a kitchen disaster...yet.</p><p>If you are a moderate klutz in the kitchen, you will immediately comprehend the title of, and the need for this book.

Once taught relentlessly to all students in the English-speaking world, grammar disappeared from most school curricula, so that terms such as "preposition" and "conjunction" now often confound children and adults alike.<br> <br>Explaining the nuts and bolts of grammar presents a special challenge, because - far more than is the case with spelling and punctuation - the subject is burdened with a centuries-old history of educational practice that many will recall as anything but glamorous. One of the world's foremost authorities on the English language, Crystal sets out to rid grammar of its undeserved reputation as a dry and intimidating subject, pointing out how essential grammar is to clear and effective speech and writing. He moves briskly through the stages by which children acquire grammar, along the way demystifying grammar's rules and irregularities and showing us how to navigate its snares and pitfalls. He offers the fascinating history of grammar, explaining how it has evolved from the first grammarians in ancient Greece to our 21st century digital environment of blogging, emailing, and texting.<br> <br>Many find grammar to be a daunting subject, but in this breezy, entertaining book, Crystal proves that grammar doesn't need to make us uneasy-we can all make sense of how we make sense.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Crystal</strong> is Honorary Professor of Linguistics at the University of Wales, Bangor. He is the author of dozens of books on language, including <em>The Oxford Dictionary of Original Shakespearean Pronunciation, The Story of English in 100 Words, Spell It Out: The Curious, Enthralling and Extraordinary</em> <em>Story of English Spelling,</em> and <em>Making a Point: The Persnickety Story of English Punctuation.</em><br><br>"A celebrated historian of the English language takes us on an entertaining stroll through the history of our grammar--from the beginning to last week. Throughout, the author is a gifted, agile, and amusing teacher."--<em>Kirkus</em> <br><p></p><br>"[David Crystal's] goal is not to flex his language knowledge, but to help clean up all the mess that prescriptive grammar teaching has caused... Crystal is on point."--<em>Popmatters </em><br><p></p><br>"A surprisingly entertaining historical and scholarly tour of the mechanics of English... [<em>Making Sense</em> is a] masterly telling of why a living language's grammar, like its vocabulary, is not only unfinished, it is unfinishable. One could not have a more genial guide for such a tour."--<em>New York Times</em> <em>Book Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"For those new to grammar, Crystal's systematic, avuncular exposition painlessly introduces concepts, keywords, and grammatical reasoning. For aficionados, Crystal provides depth and perspective--and for teachers new ideas... Essential."--<em>CHOICE Reviews</em><p></p><br>"For those new to grammar, Crystal's systematic, avuncular exposition painlessly introduces concepts, keywords, and grammatical reasoning. For aficionados, Crystal provides depth and perspective--and for teachers new ideas. The book first introduces parts of speech, clauses, and grammatical functions by tracing the language development of Crystal's daughter. Next comes a set of chapters on the role of grammar in communication and the importance of semantics and context. Crystal rounds out the book by discussing grammar change (and resistance to change) and the educational consequences of do-as-I-say-ism. Many chapters offers interludes, as the author calls them, in which the history of grammar and grammar teaching are brought to life. <em>Making Sense</em> ends with a summary of ten principles about grammar--not grammar rules but rather key ideas that encapsulate Crystal's view of grammar as an intellectual enterprise--along with an appendix on grammar teaching and testing." --<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"Crystal is the rock star of English linguistics studies, a writer and editor of more than 100 books targeted to both academics and civilians... Lucky for us, he writes with wit and charm, and is at home contextualizing language in the time of the Greeks as well as in the era of texting."--<em>Journal</em> <em>of Magazine Media</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>The Slow Plague: A Geography of the AIDS Pandemic</h2><p>Based on research by a leading geographer and specialist in diffusion theory, The Slow Plague discloses the geographic dimension of the AIDS pandemic. It provides a lucid description of the HIV, its origins, and the extent to which it has now permeated our lives. The author shows how the virus jumps from city to city, creating regional epicenters from which it spreads into surrounding areas. <p>Four case studies at different geographic scales demonstrate the devastating effects of the disease. In Africa the situation is catastrophic, in Thailand it is rapidly becoming so. In the US there are over 300,000 people with AIDS and more than one million infected by the HIV. The relationships between poverty, drugs and HIV infection are brought out poignantly in a chapter about the Bronx.</p> <p>The author argues that a real understanding of AIDS has been hampered by conscious or unconscious beliefs that those affected are, and will continue to be, confined to specific minority groups and to parts of the Third World. He shows that such views have led to fundamental misconceptions about the pattern of the spread of the disease and about those who will be most at risk, now and in the immediate future.</p></p><p><b>Peter Gould</b> has written extensively on the topic of geographic diffusion for both professional and public audiences, covering such topics as transport development in Africa, international television, and the movement to radioactive fallout. He has a PhD from Northwestern University and a DSC from the University of Strasbourg. His fourteen books include <i>Mental Maps (1972), The Geographer at Work,</i> and <i>Fire and the Rain.</i>"Stimulating, with sharp and pungent writing. The author's wide-ranging observations and speculations are full of energy and passion." <i>Nature</i> <p>"<i>The Slow Plague</i> is a clearly written introduction to geographical understanding in HIV/Aids research." <i>Abstracts on Hygiene &amp; Communicable Diseases</i></p> <p>"This fascinating book should attract a wide readership." <i>Applied Geography</i></p> <p>"The book would work nicely in an undergraduate geography or interdisciplinary topics course. It would certainly generate enough material to keep lively discussions going throughout the semester and provide every student with something to pursue in more detail for a course paper." <i>Journal of Regional Science</i></p> <p>"This makes reading this alarming book a truly fascinating experience. I use the term 'alarming' because the book is about a catastrophic pandemic which, according to World Health Organization estimates, may claim 40 million lives world-wide by the year 2000."</p> <p>"Gould is exceptionally good at presenting the 'forest' and never letting the reader get lost in the 'trees'."</p> <p>"This book would work nicely in an undergraduate geography or interdisciplinary topics course. It would certainly generate enough material to keep lively discussions going throughout the semester and provide every student with something to pursue in more detail for a course paper." <i>Journal of Regional Science</i></p> <p>"<i>The Slow Plague</i> is the most interesting and provocative publication by an academic that I can recall reading.

From Pocahontas, a Powhatan woman of the seventeenth century, to Ada Deer, the Menominee woman who headed the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the 1990s, the essays span four centuries. Each one recounts the experiences of women from vastly different cultural traditions--the hunting and gathering of Kumeyaay culture of Delfina Cuero, the pueblo society of San Ildefonso potter Maria Martinez, and the powerful matrilineal kinship system of Molly Brant's Mohawks. Contributors focus on the ways in which different women have fashioned lives that remain firmly rooted in their identity as Native women. Perdue's introductory essay ties together the themes running through the biographical sketches, including the cultural factors that have shaped the lives of Native women, particularly economic contributions, kinship, and belief, and the ways in which historical events, especially in United States Indian policy, have engendered change.<br></p><p><br><strong>Theda Perdue</strong> is Professor of History at the University of North Carolina. She is the author of <em>Cherokee Women: Gender and Culture Change, 1700-1835</em> (1998) and <em>The Cherokee Removal</em> (1995).<br><br>"A masterful collection. Clearly and concisely leads the reader through the varied and changing environments which these women faced, and whets the appitite for further inquiry into this fascinating subject. Any student of Native American life will benefit from reading this book."--<em>Indigenous</em> <em>Nations Studies Journal</em><p></p><br>"A very useful adjunct to an American history survey course. A welcome addition to the rapidly growing body of literature on Native American women."--<em>Western Historical Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"The way in which the individual authors within this volume have sifted these stories from the available evidence 'serves to personalize and feminize the story of Native America.' Consequently, reading about the fourteen women described in this book should appeal to both scholars and the general public. The editor and authors are to be particularly commended for the lively writing style that characterizes each of the bio-histories in <em>Sifters</em>. It will serve as stimulating reading for students across a variety of disciplines: Indian history, United States history, and Women's Studies."--<em>Biography</em><p></p><br>"In these carefully and intriguingly rendered bio-histories of Native women, Sifters accomplishes just what its title implies. Sifters separates the life-sustaining kernels of historical truth about these women from the nutritionless functional chaff usually provided an audience unaware of its inadequate diet. In their re-reading of these lives--of women we thought we knew, women we've genuinely misapprehended, and women we've needed to know-the book's authors also re-read and reframe significant moments in and ideas about Native history, American history."--Rayna Green, Smithsonian Institution<p></p><br>"The biographies presented in <em>Sifters</em> are equally compelling and complex, each providing glimpses into the worlds in which Native women have made choices about their lives in the past 500 years...An important contribution to the growing scholarship on Native American women and would be an excellent selection for use in classes in Native American and Women's history."--<em>H-Net</em><p></p><br>"<em>Sifters</em> is a wonderful collection of stories that would be useful to any teacher of U.S. history."--<em>The History Teacher</em><p></p><br>"Taken as a whole this book presents a well reasoned, well-researched account of a selected group of women that meets historians' and academicians' needs for information regarding specific American Indian women and their interactions with the larger socio-historical period as well as the consequences of their existence in that larger framework."--J. Anne Calhoun, University of New Mexico<p></p><br>"<em>Sifters</em> remains a valuable contribution to our understanding of both the continuity and diversity marking the lives of American Indian women at crucial persiods in history."--<em>Florida Historical Quarterly</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Foundations of Economics</h2><p><p> <b>NOTE</b>: This edition features the same content as the traditional text in a convenient, three-hole-punched, loose-leaf version.Student Value Editions&nbsp;also offer a great value; this format costs significantly less than a new textbook.

Learn about your brain, the positive effects of sex within permanently committed relationships, and how you can protect yourself (especially your brain) from the dangers of casual sex. </p></p><p><p>&#x201c;Today, thanks to breakthroughs in neuroscience research techniques, scientists have been able to literally view the activity of the brain as it functions. With state-of-the-art mapping and imaging tools, researchers have unlocked a new world of data on what happens between your ears each day. In addition, new methods of tracking brain chemicals have allowed scientists to understand when and how much of these chemicals are released and how they influence behavior. We now have scientific studies about brain function and sexual thoughts and behavior that are not only fascinating but are true breakthroughs in our understanding of ourselves and the intriguing part of our behavior called sex. </p><p>And yes, this new science does establish once and for all that more happens during sex than physical activity or the transfer of secretions, sperm, or germs. What we now know from science is what some have been saying for years&#x2014;that the largest and most important sex organ is the brain. In fact, the brain itself is being molded by sexual behavior.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;From Hooked <br></p><p>&#x201c;I had no idea having sex as a teenager could affect the rest of my life.&#x201d;</p><p>What does a three-pound brain have to do with one&#x2019;s sex life?

Ranging from the early 19th century to the 1960s, the collection reveals the development of the genre, and showcases many of its greatest expositors - from Sir Walter Scott, H.G. Wells, M. R. James, T.H. White, Walter de la Mare, and Elizabeth Bowen in the UK to Edith Wharton in America.

Looking back at the two and a half centuries that preceded the revolution, Van Kley explores the diverse, often warring religious strands that influenced political events up to the revolution.<br><br>Van Kley draws on a wealth of primary sources to show that French royal absolutism was first a product and then a casualty of religious conflict. On the one hand, the religious civil wars of the sixteenth century between the Calvinist and Catholic internationals gave rise to Bourbon divine-right absolutism in the seventeenth century. On the other hand, Jansenist-related religious conflicts in the eighteenth century helped to "desacralize" the monarchy and along with it the French Catholic clergy, which was closely identified with Bourbon absolutism. The religious conflicts of the eighteenth century also made a more direct contribution to the revolution, for they left a legacy of protopolitical and ideological parties (such as the Patriot party, a successor to the Jansenist party), whose rhetoric affected the content of revolutionary as well as counterrevolutionary political culture. Even in its dechristianizing phase, says Van Kley, revolutionary political culture was considerably more indebted to varieties of French Catholicism than it realized.<br></p><p></p><h2>Taming the Sun: Innovations to Harness Solar Energy and Power the Planet (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>How solar could spark a clean-energy transition through transformative innovation&#x2015;creative financing, revolutionary technologies, and flexible energy systems.</b></p><p>Solar energy, once a niche application for a limited market, has become the cheapest and fastest-growing power source on earth. What's more, its potential is nearly limitless&#x2015;every hour the sun beams down more energy than the world uses in a year. But in <i>Taming the Sun</i>, energy expert Varun Sivaram warns that the world is not yet equipped to harness erratic sunshine to meet most of its energy needs. And if solar's current surge peters out, prospects for replacing fossil fuels and averting catastrophic climate change will dim.</p><p>Innovation can brighten those prospects, Sivaram explains, drawing on firsthand experience and original research spanning science, business, and government<b>. </b>Financial innovation is already enticing deep-pocketed investors to fund solar projects around the world, from the sunniest deserts to the poorest villages. Technological innovation could replace today's solar panels with coatings as cheap as paint and employ artificial photosynthesis to store intermittent sunshine as convenient fuels. And systemic innovation could add flexibility to the world's power grids and other energy systems so they can dependably channel the sun's unreliable energy.</p><p>Unleashing all this innovation will require visionary public policy: funding researchers developing next-generation solar technologies, refashioning energy systems and economic markets, and putting together a diverse clean energy portfolio. Although solar can't power the planet by itself, it can be the centerpiece of a global clean energy revolution.</p><p>A Council on Foreign Relations Book</p></p><p>Varun Sivaram is a physicist and Chief Technology Officer at ReNew Power Ventures, a multibillion-dollar renewable energy firm that is India's largest. He is also a senior research scholar at the Columbia University Center for Global Energy Policy and a board member for the Stanford University's energy and environment intitutes. Most recently, he was the science and technology fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he directed the Program on Energy Security and Climate Change, and an Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University, where he taught &#x201c;Clean Energy Innovation.&#x201d; He has also served as senior energy advisor to the Los Angeles Mayor and New York Governor's Office, and as a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company. <i>PV Magazine </i>called him &#x201c;The Hamilton of the Solar Industry,&#x201d; <i>Forbes</i> named him one of its 30 under 30, and <i>Grist</i> selected him as one of the top 50 leaders in sustainability. He is the editor of the book <i>Digital Decarbonization: Promoting Digital Innovations to Advance Clean Energy Systems</i>. He holds a PhD in condensed matter physics from Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar.<p>Varun Sivaram takes us inside the world of alternative energy innovation. He's an optimist, but a realistic one: he knows time is running short for the public and private sectors to join forces. <i>Taming the Sun</i> is a must-read look into the limitless potential of an energy source as timeless as the sun that may very well save the earth.</p>&#x2015;<b>John F. Kerry</b>, 68th U.S. Secretary of State; former U.S. Senator (D-MA)<br><br><p><i>Taming the Sun</i> makes a compelling case that not confronting climate change could have dire consequences and, at the same time, makes a powerful case for the promise of solar energy.

Soon Lucy&#x2019;s struggle for independence is challenged by both her friendship with a worldly English doctor and her feelings for an autocratic schoolmaster. Bront�&#x2019;s strikingly modern heroine must decide if there is any man in her society with whom she can live and still be free.<br><br> <b>The Modern Library Torchbearers series features women who wrote on their own terms, with boldness, creativity, and a spirit of resistance.</b></p><p>With her final novel, <i>Villette</i>, Charlotte Bronte reached the height of her artistic power. First published in 1853, <i>Villette</i> is Bronte's most accomplished and deeply felt work, eclipsing even <i>Jane Eyre</i> in critical acclaim. Her narrator, the autobiographical Lucy Snowe, flees England and a tragic past to become an instructor in a French boarding school in the town of Villette. There, she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquetter. This first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape. Yet in spite of adversity and disappointment, Lucy Snowe survives to recount the unstinting vision of a turbulent life's journey--a journey that is one of the most insightful fictional studies of a woman's consciousness in English literature.""Villette! "Villette! Have you read it?" exclaimed George Eliot when Charlotte Bronte's final novel appeared in 1853. "It is a still more wonderful book than "Jane Eyre. There is something almost preternatural in its power." <br>Arguably Bronte's most refined and deeply felt work, "Villette draws on her profound loneliness following the deaths of her three siblings. Lucy Snowe, the narrator of "Villette, flees from an unhappy past in England to begin a new file as a teacher at a French boarding school in the great cosmopolitan capital of "Villette. Soon Lucy's struggle for independence is overshadowed by both her freindship with a wordly English doctor and her feelings for an autocratic schoolmaster. Bronte's strikingly modern heroine must decide if there is any man in her society with whom she can live and still be free. <br>""Villette is an amazing book," observed novelist Susan Fromberg Schaeffer. "Written before psychoanalysis came into being, "Villette is nevertheless a psychoanalytic work--a psychosexual study of its heroine, Lucy Snowe. Written before the philosophy of existentialism was formulated, the novel's view of the world can only be described as existential. . . . Today it is read and discussed more intensely than Charlotte Bronte's other novels, and many critics now beleive it to be a true master-piece, a work of genius that more than fulfilled the promise of "Jane Eyre."

He reveals how the Zoroastrian religion, which acts as a matrix for the symbols and formulas of the original form of magic, has existed for almost four thousand years with roots going back even deeper into the Indo-European past. The author reveals how all other known systems of magic have borrowed from this tradition, providing the clues that enabled him to reformulate the original Mazdan system. He reviews what the Greeks, Romans, Hebrews, Christians, and Chinese said about the Iranian-Persian tradition of the Mazdans and their invention of a magical technology. He explains how the ultimate aim of the original form of magic was not only individual wisdom, self-development, and empowerment, but also the overall betterment of the world. <br><br>Outlining the theoretical principles of this method, which can be applied in practical ways to deepen the effectiveness of these magical operations, the author details a complete curriculum of magical study and initiation based on a series of graded exercises keyed to the sacred Zoroastrian calendar. He then offers a series of more advanced magical rituals and practices based on archaic Persian formulas, including fire rituals and divine invocations. Providing a manual for the original magical system used by the members of the Great Fellowship, this book guides you toward the comprehensive practice of the Mazdan philosophy, the ultimate outcome of which is <i>ushta</i>: Happiness.</p><p>Stephen E.

Highly recommended to all serious computer scientists.Donald Knuth&#39;s influence in computer science ranges from the invention of literate programming to the development of the TeX programming language. This anthology of essays includes articles on the history of computing, algorithms, numerical techniques, computational models, typesetting, and more.</p><h2>Selected Poems (Poets, Penguin)</h2><p>A collection of poems by a major figure of the New York poetry scene in the 1960s chronicles everyday life in the city and offers selections from his 1967 work, &#34;The Sonnets&#34;</p><p>Berrigan (1934-1983) was a prolific poet and, many feel, a major figure of the second generation New York School poets. The highlight of this collection is its grand finale, a hefty selection from Berrigan's 1967 volume, The Sonnets , which changed the perception of poetry for many of its younger practitioners. The poems bear no resemblance to traditional sonnets other than (usually) being 14 lines; one can see how this uniform length and line enabled Berrigan in these early poems to withstand diversion and tomake sense out of the disorder of day-to-day goings-on. Later poems are longer, meandering in no direction and every direction at once. Fragments of songs and classic poems are inserted, adding a new and often humorous context: ``I woke up this morning / it was night / you were on my mind / on the radio.'' While often seeming juvenile, this casual effect is used to its best advantage in a few poems that turn suddenly serious, such as a sensitive elegy for his father. This volume is just long enough to display most of Berrigan's tricks yet draws to a close before readers become bored. It includes an introduction by poet Alice Notley, Berrigan's widow. <p></p><p>Copyright 1994 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Berrigan, who died in 1983 at the age of 48, was a pivotal figure in the flourishing New York poetry scene of the 1960s. Like Frank O'Hara, he wrote high-spirited poems chronicling everyday life in a city where "love can stay for only a minute/ then has to go, to get some work done." Alternately funny, pensive, energetic, and dreamy, these works reflect a life thoroughly consumed by the pleasure and pain of creating poetry. Although much of the collection is composed in the fanciful surrealist style that marks the second generation of the New York School, the most powerful lines are disarmingly direct: "Love, and work,/were my great happinesses, that other people die the source/ of my great, terrible, &amp; inarticulate one grief." Berrigan originally published most of his work in dozens of small press books, making this single-volume selection valuable to libraries with a strong focus on contemporary poetry.<br><i>- Christine Stenstrom, Shea &amp; Gould Law Lib., New York</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Martyrdom: The Psychology, Theology, and Politics of Self-Sacrifice (Contemporary Psychology)</h2><p><p>Martyrdom is a controversial and disputed concept.

They must learn to discern God at work in their own lives, shaping their hearts to embrace the particular ministries to which they are called. A Work of Heart shows how God prepares leaders today just as he did in biblical times-and how God creates these leaders in order to share his heart with his people.</p><p>No religious leader can thrive without having heart for the job. But in these times of unpredictability-caught up in trying to help others maintain their hearts-few complete their ministries without sometimes neglecting their own spiritual needs. <p>Reggie McNeal proposes that effective spiritual leaders must become experts in matters of the heart-particularly their own. Maintaining heart for the demanding work of ministry hinges on leaders' ability to discern God at work in their own lives, shaping their hearts to embrace the particular ministries to which they are called. This process of finding heart depends on an interactive partnership with God. God introduces the storyline-but the leader's responses affect the development of the drama.</p> <p>To demonstrate these points, McNeal leads readers on an excursion into the heart-shaping drama of four major Biblical leaders: Moses, David, Jesus, and Paul. He identifies the influences God used to shape them: Culture-the times and the environment in which a leader is raised; Call-the leader's personal call by God to mission; Community-the people who shape and sustain the leader; Communion-the leader's personal relationship with God; Conflict-the leader's engagement of destructive forces in life and ministry; and Commonplace-the daily choices of living. Using illustrative stories of contemporary church leaders who opened their hearts to God's guidance, McNeal shows how God is still using these same influences to shape the hearts of religious leaders today.</p> <p>God creates leaders in order to share his heart with his people. Spiritual formation in the life of the leader is not just a private matter. It has impact on the leader's constellation of followers and may extend beyond the leader's own life and lifetime. A Work of Heart is designed to help leaders develop the critical self-understanding they need to fulfill their life assignments from God.</p> <p>Spiritual leaders must become experts in matters of the heart. They must learn to discern God at work in their own lives, shaping their hearts to embrace the particular ministries to which they are called. A Work of Heart shows how God prepares leaders today just as he did in biblical times-and how God creates these leaders in order to share his heart with his people.</p> <p>"It is not just the skills of ministry that are important. The heart-sculpting work of God creates quality ministries. A Work of Heart explains how God is shaping each of us for future service." -Bob Buford, founding chairman, Leadership Network</p> <p>"We've read leadership manuals ad nauseum. We've attended every high-powered conference imaginable. We've bought the T-shirts, the three-ring binders, and all the right soundbites. But if we're honest, we're in serious drift mode, and we know it.... In A Work of Heart, Reggie McNeal has given us nothing less than CPR for the leader's soul, a book that moves us beyond leadership "how-tos" to the lifeline of genuine influence-our own intricate, passionate journey with God." -Sally Morgenthaler, author, Worship Evangelism</p> <p>"Everyone committed to developing leaders must study Reggie McNeal's understandings of heart shaping, and in doing so, will experience their own hearts being sculpted."-Donald O.

The New Shape of Postwar Socie...</p><h2>The Complete Sherlock Holmes (2 Volumes)</h2><p><b>The complete collection of&nbsp;Sherlock Holmes&#x2019;s adventures in crime, including all four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring&nbsp;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s&nbsp;classic hero</b><br><br>Volume I includes the early novel&nbsp;<i>A Study in Scarlet,</i> which introduced the eccentric genius of Sherlock Holmes to the world. This baffling murder mystery, with the cryptic word <i>Rache</i> written in blood, first brought Holmes together with Dr. John Watson. Next,&nbsp;<i>The Sign of Four</i>&nbsp;presents Holmes&#x2019;s famous &#x201c;seven percent solution&#x201d; and the strange puzzle of Mary Morstan in the quintessential locked-room mystery.&nbsp;Also included are Holmes&#x2019;s feats of extraordinary detection in such famous cases as&nbsp;&#x201c;The Adventure of the Speckled Band,&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;The Musgrave Ritual,&#x201d;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&#x201c;The Five Orange Pips.&#x201d;<br><br>Volume II begins with&nbsp;<i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>, a haunting novel of murder on eerie Grimpen Moor, which has rightly earned its reputation as the finest murder mystery ever written.&nbsp;<i>The Valley of Fear</i>&nbsp;matches Holmes against his archenemy, the master of imaginative crime, Professor Moriarty. In addition, the loyal Dr. Watson has faithfully recorded Holmes&#x2019;s exploits from &#x201c;The Adventure of the Red Circle&#x201d;&nbsp;to the twelve baffling enigmas from&nbsp;<i>The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes</i>.<br><br>Conan Doyle&#x2019;s incomparable tales bring to life a Victorian England of horse-drawn cabs, fogs, and the famous lodgings at 221B Baker Street, where for more than forty years Sherlock Holmes earned his undisputed reputation as the greatest fictional detective of all time.</p><p>This volume, authorized by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's estate, contains all 4 full-length novels and all 56 short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes. At over a thousand pages, the weighty tome is a perfect gift for budding amateur sleuths, and it is an ideal companion for a long stay on a desert island (or a leisurely trip through the English countryside). As the reader wades past the tense introductions of <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> and moves towards such classic tales as <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>, "The Adventure of the Speckled Band," and "The Final Problem," she is sure to draw her own conclusions about Holmes's veiled past and his quirky relationship with his "Boswell," Watson. Doyle never revealed much about Holmes's early life, but the joy of reading the complete Holmes is assembling the trivia of each story into something like a portrait of the detective and his creator. By the end of the long journey through London and across Europe (with a long stopover at Reichenbach Falls), one is apt to have found a friend for life. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i>Here, collected in one volume, are all four full-length novels and 56 short stories chronicling the colorful adventures of Sherlock Holmes--every word Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever wrote about Baker Street&#39;s most famous resident.</p><h2>The Inclusion Dividend: Why Investing in Diversity &amp; Inclusion Pays Off</h2><p>In today&#39;s increasingly diverse, global, interconnected business world, diversity and inclusion is no longer just the right thing to do, it is a core leadership competency and central to the success of business. Working effectively across differences such as gender, culture, generational, race, and sexual orientation not only leads to a more productive, innovative corporate culture, but also to a better engagement with customers and clients. The Inclusion Dividend provides a framework to tap the bottom line impact that results from an inclusive culture. Most leaders have the intent to be inclusive, but translating that into a truly inclusive outcome with employees, customers and other stakeholders requires a focused change effort. The authors provide straightforward advice on how to achieve the kind of meritocracy that will result in a tangible dividend and move companies ahead of the competition. With a foreword by Ana Duarte McCarthy, Chief Diversity Officer of CitiGroup.</p><p>Mark Kaplan and Mason Donovan are managing partners of The Dagoba Group, a New England based consultancy specializing in leadership development, diversity and inclusion, and organizational change. Mark is the former CEO of MGK Consulting and has been advising organizations in these areas since 1986. Mark has been published in leading diversity publications and is a guest speaker at global D&amp;L focused conferences. He earned his MA in HR Development from Villanova. For over a decade,&nbsp;Mason&nbsp;has consulted with the majority of Fortune 500 companies on talent acquisition, retention and development. He has also worked with companies to create sustainable client relationships. Mason is the author of <i>DRIVEN: A Manager's Field Guide to Sales Team Optimization</i> and is an accomplished speaker. He earned his MA in International Business from Webster University in The Netherlands. Both Mason and Mark reside in New Hampshire.<p>&#x201c;Diversity, like corporate social responsibility, is one of those buzz concepts that managers love to promote, despite not knowing how it fits into a company&#x2019;s strategic vision. Here, consultants Kaplan and Donovan provide a textbook approach to the &#x2018;diversity and inclusion&#x2019; (D&amp;I) topic, down to key takeaways and discussion exercises. The book opens by making the business case for inclusion, moves onto the psychological underpinning of bias and its effects on business, and finishes with two practical chapters on &#x2018;change strategies.&#x2019; Real world examples, like the fact that Facebook only recently added a female executive to its board or H&amp;M&#x2019;s misguided use of &#x2018;all blond mannequins in its Thirty-Fourth Street store and all brunettes in its Harlem store,&#x2019; enrich the argument.... it&#x2019;s rare to find a business book that so soundly hits the zeitgeist while also capably applying the best social sciences research to an important topic.&#x201d; (<strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong>)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;An insightful read.&nbsp;<em>The Inclusion Dividend&nbsp;</em>sheds light on core concepts for understanding diversity and inclusion dynamics and provides strategies for organizations to realize inclusion&#x2019;s full impact on the bottom line.&#x201d;&nbsp; (<strong>Edith Hunt,&nbsp;Chief Diversity Officer, Goldman Sachs</strong>)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Kaplan and Donovan help remove the veil of mystery that shrouds inclusion. It provides a much-needed narrative for organizations to rethink and reposition their journey toward ingraining sustainable diversity and closing the intent-impact inclusion chasm&#x2014;the end goal being the holy grail of pure meritocracy for all.&#x201d; (<strong>Nia Joynson-Romanzina, Head Global Diversity &amp; Inclusion, Swiss Reinsurance Company</strong>)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;<strong><em>The Inclusion Dividend</em>&nbsp;</strong>is the diversity and inclusion conversation of tomorrow we should be having with our business leaders today.

Di Dia, CEO and president of Di Dia Diversity Consulting Group, LLC and Chief Diversity Officer, Fortune 500 company</strong>)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Kaplan and Donovan make a crucial point that is sometimes missed in our enthusiasm to just 'buy' diverse talent, only to see it walk out the door a short time later: 'Only one company can be the highest paying in the industry. Money is not a long-term employee retention value. Creating a corporate culture where employees feel valued and part of a team is a longer term retention strategy.' Business leaders will benefit by heeding this advice and adopting the tools and strategies which Kaplan and Donovan effectively lay out in this book.&#x201d; (<strong>Lisa Stewart, founder of LoF Group, LLC</strong>)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;As future historians look to identify the impetus for global cultural&nbsp;change in the early 21st century, they will count this book among the&nbsp;factors for that change. <em>The Inclusion Dividend</em> provides takeaways and&nbsp;key points that are factual, informative, and stimulating. The stories&nbsp;and examples challenge us to translate diversity and inclusion into&nbsp;action.... a critical read for anyone seeking to affect positive change&nbsp;in a diverse and inclusive global society." &nbsp;(<strong>Carolyn Jones, </strong><strong>Director of Diversity and Inclusion, Fortune 500 company</strong>)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Finally, a book that ties all critical aspects of diversity and inclusion together in a way that is both theoretical and practical. The reader is provided relevant research, easy-to understand conceptional frameworks, real leadership stories, and thought-provoking exercises.
